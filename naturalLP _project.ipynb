consciousness can distinguish us from the outside and inside  this definition is widely accepted  it is enough to live well  but the price of enlightenment  is high  the basis of  the basic  research

not yet achieved  but the gravitational field of the pak prime has been successful exit  the radio signals from earlier were confirmed  despite  the surprise announcement was actually great as an extra solar  spaceship  landed on  your  second brightest  star   your little  sunshine  in  the  capital  syntari  on  pak  prime   on  the  indicators system  with  its  planets  and  other  residents  will  be  discussed  in  the course  of  the  story   currently  being  referred  to  something  else  importantly   as already mentioned   the evolutionary events  occur  in  the same universe and the paking us very similar  in form and spirit they are almost a mirror image of ourselves later we even placed a higher genetic integrity established as our own  so we began there with the construction of a ring accelerator  in space   in our model  according to  loop quantum gravity       confirmed  experimentally  that  the  quantum  geometry  and  consequently   the  spin foam  is  structurally  stable   smaller  and  on  a space time  area   due  to  this  fact   it  is  possible  information  and  a complete  transport  geometry  transfer   the  spin  network  recognizes  no difference  the space can in itself is no background but even a dynamic    object creation and the disappear  the large energy while forcing him to extinction in the direction of transport and behind the new sprouting  the structural changes  in the spin network are propagated only apparent on the speed of light away  in fact  they are similar to the short time space  the  capsule  is  thus  precisely  positioned  in  space   the material  in  the accelerator  on  a  collision  shortly  before  leaving  the  ring  switch   the immense  energy  is  then  released  in  the  all  exactly  the  direction  of gamma  ii   in  this  inferno   the  low  distortion   the  freely  suspended  in space  capsule  carried away and over  again  released  how  is  it  good question   as  with  the  sneezing  of  heart  exposed  and  we  are  totally unaffected by  this   the  journey will be  in  the worst  room  with a perfect microscope you can see billions of times more accurate than with such a telescope  but briefly the principle on the large scales  due to the energy released  and  the  space  topology  merge  the  room  facing  each  other briefly  in  the  so called  bubble perel  plan   by  diffusing  the  variety  of information  exchange  is  forced   the  spin stable  transport  capsule  will wear  the  shrunken  space time  areas  in  the  transport  direction  and  via emerging space points behind you to the finish  even if the technology is constantly  being  developed  is  currently  the  human  effort  to  funnel through  the  tunnel  immense   therefore   between  the  adjacent  systems takes place only a small passengers  travel is limited to a few influential people  however  there is a lively exchange of messages found in almost real  time  information transfer consumed because of  the negligible mass significantly  fewer resources  the step generators can be applied  in  the room only in the conventional manner  to the nearest star  a binary star system with  no  planets   it  last  even       light  years   this  is  clearly  too much for us today and in the long run  furthermore  a planet less binary system  little  interesting   so  we  wet  the  feet   but  overall  we  just  hang around on our static random space time point zero  the comprehensive theory explaining includes large and small these things even though the latter word to one hundred percent wrong  they live quite well without the truth  this is also a lie and yet different as untrue  you see  without using the central word you fail hopelessly  it would do more to read about this theory  which is impossible although the article  too much to bear  so true it  is   people  generate  local  actions   kingdoms   civilizations   dynasties  gekl ngel  fighting  greed and selfishness determine us in everyday life  the  time has  come  we approach  away  from physics  and  towards  the    beginning of  the story    iv  kingdom of a thousand  it  has been shown that puts in a democracy but with increasing networking and technicality  only even  the best marketer  in power  through all  of  these candidates  the  legal  form  of  parliamentary  monarchy  has  remained  constant  president  is  the  king   the  royal  line  goes  back  ultimately  to  the  ruling family  of  the  westarp  in  ancient  times     to  break  the  problem  of  the polished  president  since  the  exchange presidential  scandal  over      years   the  legal  form  was  changed  to  the  so called   kingdom  of  a thousand    in this pool are the first  thousand heirs of  the old monarchy  that  is  the direct descendants of those westarp  the so enthroned king  the queen  is both head of state and head of government and also head of the armed forces of the raah system  overthrow him can theoretically only a three fourths majority of the thousands  if it agrees  with two thirds of the parliament  this  however  occurred before  the selection process of the young ruler after the death of the old  is sophisticated  to put  it  to formulate flat  ehrgeizler  careerists  freaks and also hyper intelligent fall through  the  latter are seeking  to do more of a scientific  career  trivial power poker  you leave it to others   for its parliament to qualify every   years   the brightest minds  in science  economics and social  issues  that are  called  according  to  a  test  procedure  in  parliament   they  are authorized to issue instructions to your resort to the municipal level  this means the city and regional parliaments receive regulations and report to  the  top   the  kingdom  is  a  thousand  of  the  thus  politically  not  a democracy  democrats  however  goes into the personal rights of industry to the local authorities and education  the basic law of rights is generally accepted and legal form has proven itself  people s voice is brought near the future agents during their  training at universities  the daily business is controlled and the immense amount an election all x years planet and even two star systems to organize far away falls  for the past     years  this system has proven successful   in  the hall of kings are real  figures  carved in stone  in remote indi system is  independent of  the lifetime of the king always a senior member of the thousand as president  instead of the king    as the official title  his life in power  the underlying structures are  similar   one  somewhat  neglected  the  remote  system   because  we were from the conquest of space  the center of power is here  there are special  cases  understandable  but  also  unusual  in  the  system   if  the chosen  dies  in  the  first  ten  years  of  his  term   it  is  usually  so  that  their    spouse does the top function  this choice is necessary  just this one will be spared even by the principle  the second person in the state it is also close  to  the power and enjoys  the confidence of  the  instances  only  in exceptional cases by two thirds majority of the thousand can be tilted  it is rare to is already done once  this fury wanted to see anyone in front  something peculiar  is  that only  the  ruler and his children may not even bear the name of westarp  the death of the first man in the state and his descendant is too weak for the test to decide so he gets another title of nobility  from  the  thousand  namensaum  assigned    v   ancient   cold through  the hall  of kings  just  the  ruler of  the entire system raah indi  queen hypatia  i below   flanked by your major general pavel rebelkov   the existence of  a  regent  is  unbearable over  there on pak prime  my queen   which  is  being  scaled  down    he  rattles  monotone    their popularity  and  pseudo compatibility  makes  it  more  dangerous  for  us  letting go is growing  my queen is a dangerous trend     keep your hair rebelkov   you  are  too  short tempered    him  rebukes  the  queen   she continues    when  you  come  to  ours  for  less   it  is  the  paking  you  can know the past     forgive your need to worship  but now take this band  there were better candidates  bad that the little bastard of which just this year must start school  your most well born son  together  in a year with this breed  at the same school  rattling the general   my good rebelkov  you are a poor  tactician and  strategist    is  your  short  answer  hart  has become  you  in  your  trains  and  in  the  essence   since  the  death  of  her husband  shortly  before  the  birth  of  your  only  child   prince  of  westarp herold  today  twelve years later  here in lyporo whose enrollment in the royal institute of applied sciences alanis on the plan  a noble house noble past  many  smart  and  influential  people  created  by  it   but  even  in  this proud and prestigious boarding school has done in recent weeks  things that were impossible in the old order  anti discrimination laws  a hundred years  old   allow  multi species  classes  in  some  subjects  and  the exchange  in  the  playground  due  to  the  integration  of  the  species  into daily life here on the trivy you went in that direction  most of this support  some few will refuse   humbly  my lady  a college where they teach now the pigs on  the trymoo  where  is  the world coming  to   mild smile she replies     rebelkov   i  have  to  point  out  that  you  also  keep  your  home clean ruba    very good swing sovereignty  feather dusters  you may as i m concerned  but  to  learn  the separated part  also   i ve got  it yes  to    this  pardon my queen  tried cursed tin pails  cruel how stupid they are     a  steady  flow  problems  with  any  systems  and  quasi  too  lazy  in  the evening to hang on the wall socket  only the dirtiest activities or war are applicable      almost  pity  the queen hypatia  turned  again  to  your  loyal general   war  tsa tsa tsa  hundreds of years ago  but i agree with you that our order could be better enforced  perhaps we should  really bring everything  over  there  purely  compatibility   maybe  your  plan  is  right  besides  why should i reject this offer also    at the other end of the hall is  a  friendly looking  collection  of  people  who  entertain  the  excited  and interested  look   some  even  nod  appreciatively   it  looks  like  you  came from far away  less because of your appearance  suggesting nobility  or because of travel hardships  no  much more so because the environment will  obviously  something  fremdelt   the  delegation  will  travel  from  the high born  family  of  regents  of  pak   dr   leviathan  westerburg  furthermore   from  his  wife   ratia   high  representatives  of  the  indians system  and  finally his  twelve year old son henley  dr  westerburg was first noticed by the close of its regent  although the protocol allows him to welcome  the queen   he  knows  that  you preferred  it  if  he  disregards  it   my dear cousin  it s nice to welcome you here in lyporo  did you have a pleasant  journey       your majesty   i  should  thank you  for  the  invitation  well  only a fool called the tunnel boring  travel without moving hat was  it is a privilege for us all to be here  to visit again and again exciting the system of all our ancestors  much has happened  in lyporo  here  in  the hall   the  time seems  to be a constant     when she had been waiting  to the last sentence hypatia answered   how predictable  the scholar says  there  is  so much more  important   so  this  is  the  young  prince henley  your son    thus it happens it that turns to hypatia i  queen of the raah  indi system for the first time henley of westerburg  it honors his mother not  look  at  it   then  it  is  trained   we  are  not  interested  in  ratia  to westerburg what  you  think  and  feel  you  do  not  care  when  the  young prince is different  he is enrolled in a year with your own son  what feels a  twelve  year  old  when  he  looks  up  at  the  familiar  face  of  a  foreign person is any individual but the entire system looks familiar  well  there is no antipathy  since twelve years in most cases are more humane  but in general there is respect for this disciplined  almost ascetic awe inspiring appearance   your  clothes  with  the  rest  to  that   simple  elegance combined with unfathomable  thus  henley bowed briefly  in silence  he    sweeps  you  a  fraction  of  a  second  over  his  head  and  says    clean  henley   he  is  very  reserved   well  educated   never  say  what  is  false  fabulous     this should probably be a compliment   thinks henley  just at that moment will open a wing and some come out  looking  three strictly military  among them is prince and herald of westarp  hypatia s twelve  year  son   he  is  also  controlled  by  extraordinary  facial  expressions  dressed he  is   this  is worth mentioning  in  the  dark  gray  uniform of  the royal  guard  advisor   unusually  for  a  young  prince   he  seems  older  though he physically corresponds to his age  but he seems to accept his role  more than that  evidently  they liked him  much can be thought of in his  sight   if  one  day  he  king   if  he  wins  the  competition  in  his  favor  inconceivable  however  and never happened   that he  runs  in shorts on the  football  field and play a game of  football with  their peers  real time simulations  on  the  computer  are  as  dear  to  him   military  education arouses enthusiasm for strategy  weapons technology and the army  the guard bows just before the regent and will stop  herald continues on his mother   buried  a  hand  casually  in  his  pants    there  are  important  and special days  today is a  she says   just when you got to know your son  levi  now  it s  time  to  think of  it   she  turns  to  the young prince    you re like always on time  herald   he nods gratefully  a verbal response is not forthcoming  he sees himself  preferring instead to travel delegation from another  planet  with  interest   the  same  age  henley  he  seems  to  be interested only  in  the second  this adolescent  spends most  time  in  the presence  of  adults   with  private  teachers  or  in  the  network    herold  remember  you  still  to  dr   west  castle   the  president  of  the  king  over there  instead  of  india    his  mother  asked  him   herold  turned  to  mr  westerburg but a single question to him burns on his  lips   what about the tunnel   he stumbles go  for the first time his age needs  he still lacks the experience  what bothers him  although he has already read anything about it   how does the capsule  is it true that you will be weighed to the gram exactly     well   begins dr  westerburg but hypatia interrupts him   herold  there s so much more exciting than the vile art  i m sure there will be soon a  job  for  you over  there  in  india    after a dramatic pause   by then  you ll  wait  up       very  well   mother    he  mutters   the  queen continued    now  we  are  only  together  once  cozy  and  festive  dinner  travelling  makes  you  hungry   the  courtly  eemits  have  prepared  new delicious  creations  of  the  finest  meals  for  you   let  us  therefore  take    action    thus the welcome ceremony is officially over  after this feast  the delegations will pursue your own activities  the main indicators of distant political   such  as meetings  or  meetings  of  your  department  colleagues raah  of course  the school starts a topic in westerburg will be mainly for the young ratia and henley  ultimately  one wishes this delegation in the most  stability   more  of  their  own  skills  and  an  early  departure  in  the home  even if you have to leave his son  pavel rebelkov who has kept discreetly  in  the  background during  the  entire  conversation   look  at  the next days and weeks too happy  but his plans go in a completely different direction   her  majesty s  most  loyal  general  is  planning  a  coup   a conspiracy  something monstrous    vi  on one  line rebelkov agitated  for weeks he has been working both in private and with some subjects in the project  code named  new order    for  the  final  presentation  in  which  for  the  first  time  the queen maximum self  to be present   the general  has  come up with  something special   this  meeting  will  be  held  at  his  home  address  in  his  estate outside lyporos  preparations are  in full swing  all ruba   in your simple mind now are inspired  on the ball  you are in your element  like children  you  can  focus  on  a  single  task  and  budgetary  matters    ravenosch  rebelkov  barks    everything must  be  spotless  tomorrow   every  square millimeter of the entrance to the conference room must sparkle and flash    from your work torn  visibly surprised and confused ruba jumps to see your lord and master in the face  she replies   yyyy meista  iss all good  we  make  it   we  are  happy      it  is  almost  impossible  for  the  friendly  simple and industrious nature of a ruba antipathy or even hatred towards match   unless  one  is  a  battle  robot  is  programmed  to  destroy   or  a heartless general  he  replied  curtly    i  hope  your well  is  good enough  otherwise you re flying  now   you wince  the cloth in his hand  of which he inspired continues   then you can offer your services  whoever  never again  will  you  come  in  such  a  noble  household   most  likely  you ll  be unemployed and i even know what that means for one of you    oh yes  he  has  right   a ruba without  a  job  is  a  sad  creature  she  immediately lowered her head and cleans obsessively on in all corners and all edges  the next day  today time has come you will  for five weeks he is working towards this moment  the previous meetings took place exclusively with the military in the general office of the ministry of defence  on this day  that  is   the crowning glory  under his personal direction  is subsequently    presented his project to the improved order in the presence of the queen in  person   promptly  at  ten  meetings   the  first  strategists  of  your  army  young aspiring tactician are also lower  the oval table in the conference  hall is filling up rapidly  rebelkov enters the room  the entropy increases  immediately  formed a cluster  tributes  to be  feigned    sir   i am at your complete  disposal   welcomed  him  alepto  retzlav   an  aspiring  young major   rebelkov  appeased    gentlemen   i  ask  you  now  to  take  place  why we are here  we all know  however  i beg to countenance  especially as our commander  in chief  is on his way here     of course sir   replied retzlav and does diligently to his seat flit  the tension is high in the hall  despite  the wonderful ambiance  a chamber  in  the house  sun  flooded through the glass front of the winter garden  with its precious orchids and hundred year old bonsai  rebelkov is from the old school  he is no friend of  technology    everything  can  be  heard    he  thinks  the  best  is  still  the direct communication  strange  however  that it be integrated in desktop monitor   informing him  first  he  raises his arms  all  chickens smothered murmur  then he just says  time has come   everyone knows what was meant   two  bodyguards  of  her  majesty  the  leaves  open   hypatia  i appears  on  the  scene   immediately  jump  to  the  participants  from  their seats and stand at attention  rebelkov you make  at the entrance facing the  front side of  the  table  your place  is  the opposite back of  the  room  with  a  possible   although  unlikely  attack  while  browsing  the  furthest away   the  best  protected   this  rule  dates  back  to  ancient  times  but  no one  dares  to  question   let  alone  find  fault  it   is  also  back   the  last unsuccessful  attack more  than  two  hundred  years   as  you might  also  the regent of  two solar systems  a direct descendant  from the ancient race  of  those  westarp   parliament  president  and  commander  in  one person   it  is  present   in  full  regalia     their  appearance  and  now  you invade a single demonstration of nobility and power  at each step softly rustling  your  m nzkrone   what  is  an  absolute  dominance   such  an extraordinary  special  position  possible  in  an  enlightened  and  modern society   imagine growing up  in a system   the  living memory of a single dynasty  ruled  is passable  there were always difficulties  but are being replaced  since  the  president  has  steadily  improved   the  list  of achievements  is  long   the  system  of  thousands  of  proven   excellent candidates  since  the  early  days  everyone  here  knows  the  stories  and legends  abound  in  this  ancient  noble  family   the  flesh  of  these  top  of    society  to  face  the  top  division  takes  your  breath  away   the  power position of  the  imperial  crown  is absolute  even  if  one of  you killed  the system would automatically determine one of westarp  quite apart  from the fact that the bombers bring the rest of his life in the vex grave could  without  looking  at  the  picture   let  alone  with  any  person   including rebelkov contact with them  she says in the room while you continue on your course zuschreitet  the following words   generals gentlemen  take a  seat   buy  everything  fits  she  continues    well  you  have  found  here rebelkov  especially like the garden   the winter garden was meant  then says in a fit of spontaneity   tilting but sometimes one is a window that is a bit more of the mood inside is here   tumult  three young majors jump sit  with  his  back  to  the winter  palace  in  garden   alepto retzlav  is  the fastest  he  tilts  the window and  looks with  treudoofem dachshund  look over  in the direction of his commander  in chief  this makes no move to return  the gaze  his  form has already been deleted  from the short term memory   instead   she  says    better  is   and  spread  out  your  arms    so rebelkov what you tell us   the general waits a second until all heads are turned towards him  he begins   commander in chief  gentlemen  you all  know  that  our  order   ultimately  limited  by  the  physics   could  be enforced  over  in  indi  system  better   our  influence  and  thus  loses  the ancient  kingdom  of  power      some  generals  turn  to  each  other   alepto rezlav  attracts  a  very  important  expression  was  that  the  occasion  on which they have waited so long  for some time now  the saying sneers of  the   washing and cleaning  the army   the glory days are  long gone  rebelkov  continues    the  current  president  of  king s  workshop   dr  leviathan westerburg  over in syntari on pak prime      he looks around telling      is  sub optimal  for  us    major  retzlav  smiles  consensus    the paking    the  general  continued    so  this   i  will  sometimes  call  local hominids       faces carved blocks in the round   you re actually hearing   re amused  faces  at  the  table   retzlav  must  now  losbellen  easy  probably because of its gerademal the age of     he believes himself to be  very  imaginative    we  could  simply  make  him  disappear   he s currently here  a small technical defect in the tunnel  ready   alepto looks hopeful  in  the  face of his superiors   the slap comes but once    retzlav  are  you  mad    he  begins   this  is  in  bright  red   yes   it  is  possible  to mutate  within  a  second  of  tomato    the  physicists  wait  but  only  one incident  then make  the system close  to us  immediately  travel  is  then    no longer possible in the long run  we can be happy that the technology works as stable  sir    the last two words he emphasized particularly  the alepto retzlav now  fully exposed  to  the public  ridicule  honest  laughter breaks out  even hypatia i just pulls the eyebrows up   no  no  we must be more subtle   he says  now confidently twice   if we can prove that the local  authority  will  fail  if  we  run  the  paking  realize  how  blind  to westerburg   then  the  legislature  can  make  changes  in  our  favor    he looks  around   everyone  in  the  room  listen  with  rapt  attention   so  he continues   emergency laws are an excellent means of disempowerment  the days of open war  which are long gone  but how are we to achieve what  you  suggest      murmur   but  no  open  speech   this  is  rebelkov s hour  suddenly  almost inaudibly  between the whispers a grinding noise  no  one  other  than  the  general   it  is  noticed   this  has  an  immediate suspect  but in contrast to the young major retzlav we see no change in his face  he quickly adds   terrorism  terror attacks  we take this pack    his common synonym for the paking   where it hurts you the most  for details  gentlemen  come into play  i m sure you will find something nice   pause  the cat  is out of  the bag    what  if we  fly up    says one of  the addressee    the damage would be  immense    impatient with  the  fingers typing rebelkov barks back   here sits the head of our military  the best  trained generals  and  strategists  of  a  two star  system  highly  decorated instances  of  an  ancient  monarchy   the  elite   you  come  to  me  with failure   there  can  be  no  such     derided  the  cuts  entered  his  head  rebelkov is now in a rage  he gets up  gesticulating wildly   ultimately  a much larger target to be achieved   retzlav  now back to normal colors  lost  listens in awe  he waits anxiously as everyone else on what is now hoping    our  highly  well born  queen   and  your  noble  son  is  to  be presented  to  the  crown   as  before   the  new  manifestation  of  a  solid succession  the abolition of the kingdom of thousands  that must be our highest goal    silence in the room  except for the gentle breeze from the other side of the conservatory and then a gray  almost inaudible sound  in this  situation   however   is  neither  the  first  nor  the  second  or  anything significant   much  too  large  the  tension  and  excitement  is  now  that  the internal  real  projects  on  the  table   a  brutal  intervention  in  the  existing order  after an eternity  actually only a  few seconds passed   the earned altgardist  chrysostom  helmet  jet  wishes  to  speak   a  man  was  seen coming  and  going  of  already  one  or  the  other  and  rebelkov    sir   my    queen  we risk  losing our humanity  to give up our principles    the  latter turning your head in his direction   of course all of this  however  perched on my absolute loyalty to the reigning monarch  is more  this oath has gathered  each  done  here   their  presence  very  same are  committed  to the highest discretion   to  silence     do not dare  to  interrupt   the queen waits  for  his  subsequent  comments    this  round  table  is moving  at  an unprecedented  gray  area  on  thin  ice   their  presence  alone  revered hypatia befielt us be silent   expressionless she sees him still ongoing   if it is missing i would be tomorrow requires the assembly of a thousand to go  to  the  plan   you  know  that  i m  assuming  everything  said  is  in  your interest   your majesty     everyone present  looks  right  into  the void  no one  but  the  altgardisten  would  have  dared  to  ask  such  a  question  everyone is aware of  the here and now history is written  slowly  slowly  carefully   you  replied  the  following  words    general  jet  helmet   yes  i remember  exactly  how  my  husband   king  iii  of  antonin  westarp  then created  in  the  palais  des  samtrigwall  palace  crowning  the  insignia  of power   even  your  words  i  remember  exactly      helm  beam  listened intently   responsibility  a maximum of  it  restrictions  and committed to the vital interests of the system     i never agreed with full knowledge of this  meeting  and  decided  to  participate  because  the  statements rebelkovs vote  i write this   while this is sitting there only head slightly down  but  inwardly happy   the move is a return to monarchy surprised me  but  again  i  agree  we  live  in  times  of  change   especially  over  the indians   however   there  are  times  the  technical  stability   what s  been added  since  the  tunnel   we  need  change  us  over  there  or  you ll  slip through your  fingers     such remarks are unusual  for you  only on very special  occasions  you  mentioned  your  late  husband   king  antonin  iii  she continues   the suffering less of the higher good of our position here in lyporo is acceptable  in accordance with my powers i command a vital regental oath and hereby to the fullest support of the proposal rebelkov  such  an  oath  is  the  highest to get  command  no  one   even  jet  helmet has  ever  received  such  a  plan   only  heard  about  him  known      if  this should be any different opinion  he lifted his arm and then

westerburg now in lyporo  a time of great boredom  as a young prince  you  have  to  know  it s  hard  someone  the  same  age  one  can  say  that even after all  these days  henley  found a single  friend  at  the welcome dinner  i  was  hypatia s  been  agreed  the  times  herald  invites  him  to accompany his daily  routine  but  this has never been  reported  hypatia also  show  itself  was  a  one idea  although  they  see  every  day  several times   in  the  main  news   so  it  is  only  natural  that  henley  against  his feverish  first day  tomorrow  what will  await him  there anyway  what  is this  strange  institution  all  teaching materials  are  provided   each  year  new curricula and courses on the program  the teachers rotate  we call the concept of  rolling stability   a flexible system to respond to changes  henley also called his father responds directly to this can only shrug his    shoulders  he went over there in syntari on pak prime to school   you ll see  it will  be  better  than expected  after  all  herold  is  reflected  in  your year    was his  reply    oh great  hopefully  i ll meet  there someone else  thinks the young prince   oh yes  one more thing  henley  leviathan is a  there is a technical  military history   not a must  but i would look forward if you could prove it  hypatia person has even mentioned  herold  it also takes     ok  henleys short answer  is  but he does a  little corner of  the mouth downward  henley  is particularly  looking  forward  to  teaching  that is  multicultural   in  the  system  there  is  no  indica ruba   it  is  far  too expensive such cheap labor through the tunnel to smuggle  on the other hand   is  also  known  to  exo   the  prairie  moon  of  the  pak  prime   the aircraft etto  furthermore  floating on pak secundo  the outer world of ice on bear like burht havoc  but that s it  impossible to teach  the birds are intelligent  and  well organized  bear   but  in  this  case   the  keyword  local humane intelligence without having to devalue its correct  the capital of the pak prime  syntari  henley s home city   is ultimately too westerburg also alien city  as you look at the historical capital of paking was and is  none  known  at  the  court  westerburg  a  paking  as  foreign   they  are humans like us  since take ruba missing as cheap labor  you often duty activities   even  if  no  one  is  talking  about  it  can  be  assumed  that  the genetic  integrity  of  the  two  species  originally  from  two  different  worlds exists  only  on  paper   henley  even  remembers  with  pleasure  his  first encounter with these rugged northern men  his whole family was invited last  year  to  mid summer  night  by  the  head  of  the  region  sarpsborg  eivind  lund  barden  was  a  mountain  of  a  man  but  he  was  constantly placed  jokes   he  even  has  a  daughter  in  henley s  age   eevi  lund barden   a  girl  with  bright  blue  eyes  and  blond  hair   most  paking  have long  blonde mane   they  are  party  animals   freedom loving  nature  boy  all  even the women are tall  only your taste in music to him is a bit too extreme   too bad that does not paking will be on the school   he thinks to himself  before he  falls asleep    henley  time  to get up    his mother shook him ratia   you want to be on time but on the first day   he gets up  but it is a bit dull to him in the stomach  the bread tastes worse than usual an hour later  he is slick and functional  dressed with his mother on campus  with  the  other  first graders   what  an  a  mixed  bunch   is  that interesting  quite differently than expected  as a particularly funny ruba family   the boy seems was overwhelmed  he constantly  shows  in other    directions   parents  also  found  enthusiastic   another  difference  to  the people   by  contrast   the eemits   leisurely  people  strong  shape  getting used  to  the  sight   as  mixing  between  two legged  turtle  and  crocodile  even  your  children  are  almost  suspiciously  low   rough  estimate   two thirds of  the  students men and  the  rest  equally  distributed  to  the ruba and eemits  only herald of

resembles  more  of  a  senior  teacher  vekter  comedian  for  a  person  of respect   his  bobbing  gait  underlines  this   he  hops  on  the  amount  of curious  glances  were  directed  to  him   broad  grin   he  begins    hu  everyone  welcome to the college of applied sciences alanis  love kids and  consorts   some  of  the  last  look  at  each  other   the  children  make great eyes  all of  the above mentioned seems particularly excited  to be small  ruba   with  open  mouth  he  looks  at  him   the  qualifications  of director regis vekter s are obviously hidden  in any case  there must be other people than to be welcomed or hold a welcome sermon  impossible that  a  clown  this  prestigious  and  well situated  house  heads    soderle dear  pupil   pupils  and  new  arrivals   hmm   the  latter  would  have  been enough   he  clears  his  throat    today   therefore   for  you  begin  the  real life  this in turn means for the da      he points the finger at random with a few adult human species   the other he can    the  fact  that  you can say goodbye  now   i  personally  take  the  age much  too  seriously   yes      so shake a bit puzzled by all the parents again the hands of your offspring  or hug one last time  do not worry dear rascals  with the word he means both large and small   our system of networked individuality has already brought generations of students in front of you on the right track  you will also  ridiculous  these  few more  years  to  survive  well  apart  exceptions   again  he  smiles  on both  cheeks   the  joke  seems  to  like  him more    a word  to  the  relatives  our office  is always  to achieve   you know  online and  by  phone   we  have  your  data  there   you  will  get  your communications package   he is now

the briefing   he asks  she nods  patchara petch is  a boon a diplomat s daughter from the provinces of the rising sun here on the trivy  henley knows  little at  this point how much  is  linked  their  fate once  currently   he  is  glad  to  have  found  the  first  time after more  than forty  days  with  a  friend   the  building  is  functional  in  design   was  on unnecessary  frills  deliberately   clean  lines  dominate   in  contrast  to  his appearance seems regis vekter s spirit to be so tidy  however it must be said  that  this  educational  institution was built  long before  his  time   it  is chaotic  the chaos surrounding  others prefer simplicity and empty rooms  pragmatism  prevails  in  the  clothing  of  students   not  one  is  wearing  a hawaiian  shirt   baggy  pants  or  other  brightly  colored  couture   if  even color   then decent and plain  expressionism in  fashion or ever changing trends  run  after  which  it  will  have  disappeared  for  centuries   the auditorium  is  reached soon  regis goes  to his  lectern  hippolyta  in  tow  approximately  in  the  middle  of  the  room  then  he  is  also   herald  of westarp  as always  one hand  in his pocket  the one who  looks at him like a disgruntled teacher  as he had three looks  liubomir iliev  a teacher of military history  retired  herold is soon surrounded by some guys who think more or less stupid with him  this cluster attracts attention of many  except  for  patchara  petch  boon a henley  and  prince  of  westerburg  they  giggle  at  telling    no  way  in  the  first  series   henley  says  to  you  totally inconspicuous   a quick glance einvernehmen because he knows you  agrees   at  the  forefront  of  crowd  anyway  just   well   the  usual suspects   henley  looks  around   he  seeks  the  zappligen  ruba  from before  this  is  to discover  however  nowhere  this  is now ready vekter regis  enrollment  speech  to   he  clears  his  throat   curious  eyes  to  see him   alanis college  lalala  who devil has you riding here to get started     an  opening  sentence  of  surprise  at  the  students  and  causing  slight shaking of the head in the college  especially the military teacher seems angry  as  before   part  of  the  teaching  team  is  also  there   behind  the lectern on  the wall  they are around  most of  you but  let s  assume  you know your director  after all  he is twenty years in the post   seven years of training are now available to you that my speech is finished   silence in the room  then slap some of the new students helpless   stop  wait  i can think of something one  haha   he waving   the first thing i would like to    welcome  prince  of  westarp  herold   the  son  of  our  revered  queen hypatia  i   which  is  also  the  patron  of  this  noble  house    it  shows  both arms invitingly in the direction of the addressed  this time also the severe liubomir  iliev  clapping  eagerly   the  drones  throw  around  to  herald admiring  glances   the  presented  itself  takes  on  the  greeting  without visible  emotion    networked  individuality  means  less  adherence  to tradition rather than modernity and the avant guard in the teaching field   included most of the newcomers  henley  had no idea what exactly was meant   too  many  foreign  words   just  understand   he  continued    we could not care where you gain your knowledge  we even matter whether you attend classes at all    now he turns off completely well  besides  he is suddenly the  you  arrived  apparently he has forgotten that there are twelve years before him  it can also be everything he says as he sees fit and  the  style  it  is more  than matter    but  one  thing  you must  be  clear  there is a basic rule  a clear instrument that shows us whether you are eligible  for  a  transfer       now  it  gets  exciting    henley  thinks   like most others  too    the  examination  period  is  exactly  determined   the examination  dates  of  all  subjects  in  grades  one  through  seven  are already fixed  for all subjects in which you are  in addition to enroll your four  main  subjects   you  have  to  this  day   exactly  at  this  hour  be personally present    the incredulous looks abound  he continues   if you want  to  reach  the next grade give added  there were enough helpful   in other words  two five sticks  many are now pinched faces  what is this  you can skip easily  only to check to be there  cool  finally  the director says    yes  it  is  with  two or more poor no  transfer  is possible  you can select  other  subjects   the  school  leaving  stage  an  attack  or  to  hang himself   true  to  the motto   if all else  fails   i ll hang on me   children are unbiased  they learn quickly  sure you have understood its rationale and hide his strange sense of humor  in addition  standing still is very hard  so heavy  applause  breaks  out   everyone  is  curious  how  it  goes  now  pleased  to  note  the  popularity vekter regis  au  he points  to hippolyta and  nods  to  you  shortly   this  occurs  now  in  front  of  the  microphone where  she  stumbles  slightly  she winks  at  the  crowd   apparently  it  is  a little nervous  also  your oversized glasses constantly sliding towards the nose  tip    dear  students  my name  is hippolyte  trick  only a  few smile because of her surname  but some of the drones there   do not worry i m not a  teacher  but  i  run only  the secretariat here  so you can say  i am    responsible for the schriftkram   above are some of your sheet of paper  rummaging  in  it    so   where  were  we   ah  yes   in  a  few minutes  to  be transferred to your comms plans  including the hours of elective courses offered       it  should  be  noted  that  four  of  the  nine  single species  are compulsory  subjects   these  consist  of   science   language   planetary science  and  economy   they  must  necessarily  be  occupied  by  each student       the  remaining  five  multi species  are  electives   this  you provide us to the end of next week  you are invited to try out all the time      yes   certainly   prince  westarp  herald  of  the  elective   inter regional communication  appear with rubas and eemits on the scene      if up to this point have any questions   she looks around  no one raises his arm  herold talks quietly with his hearing   the special is now  she continues   that each subject and each hour  is offered several  times per week  so there  is  no  fixed  classes  but  only  one  such  year       change  your comrades can  the advantage is that you all know it   she pauses briefly   is there now a little unclear  log in quiet    hesitantly picks up a discreet girl  your  hand   nod  your  hippolyta    i  have  two  questions    says  the student   is there a class president  i also wanted to ask if we have fixed school  holidays      the  secretary  looks  at  you  with  gratitude  and  said   good  question   to one   no   there  is  neither  a  class  representative  or vintage  speaker   there  are  no  parents   evenings   everyone  counts  the same and can always come to us  this also holds true for your parents     for  the  second  point   yes   there  are  fixed  holiday  periods  of  constant through the seasons but also normal holidays  such as at the founder s    all  of  this  can  be  found  in  the  near  future  to  your  comms  with  your enrollment documents   she takes a deep breath  you can see in her that she  is  happy  if

like a really  well  after the first lap of honor before he  flies  out       then  you  will  see  that  there  is  only  exactly  one  alanis college  believe me about it  you are privileged  you have caught it very well   some  of  your  parents  have  really       oh  just  forget  it      use  your unique opportunity   i wish you  luck   she wiped a handkerchief over his forehead  she does not look to the relief  regis vekter steps forward and    knocks your short on the shoulder and says  turning to the students   still alive  good  grade one     hippolyta shows you now the way over to the dining room  we teachers are at  last  in our teaching  after all   there are six other volumes except you  i may see one or the other but soon    he makes a final gesture  applause coming from all sides  then the amount is  slowly  moving    viii   svinenysh  patchara  petch a boon  runs  beside henley  she is lost in thought thinking about something sharp  she asks   do you have what you take   just at that moment shaking your comms   ha   henley says   what a coincidence  this must be the  lesson plans   you dig out your mobile phones  without these small computers is hard to imagine a life  each student has a communication apparatus  the front is  in  their entirety  from a screen   the back  is made of solar cells   in  the middle is the energy storage and energy transmitter installed  to charge it   you  shall  briefly  with  the  face  downward   battery  chargers  can remember any more  the efficiency of the panels is so high that you can even download the telco in the

 even brighter green than the trymoo  there are a total of six stages on the night trivy  including  the moon phases  on  the day all  these effects are  of  course  not  significant   back  to  the

equivalent    look  patchara    inter regional  communication    cross species learning experiences  cultures  and field trips  that sounds great on     oh yeah  we eat   she says  as excited as he   military history   the glorious past  a chance for future generations  i think i must take      henley pulls a muscle  then he says   well  is only an hour    have you already  found  something  nice   patchara    she  is  lost  in  your  comm  compares  all  the  data   after  a  short  while   you  think   i ll  solares management  computer science and social design    henley laughs   ok  the first two are for me  the interpersonal bla bla bla  i leave you    then yes  missing  only  a  subject   patchara   mutters   blinking  wildly   with flashing  eyes   you  control  your  comm   then  the  relief    here   henley     look  evolution or medical robot technology  what do you say     so i find the  metal  bucket  while  funny   but  i  think  a  bit  about  our  biology  is exciting   patchara nods  so you have your nine subjects together when you  arrive  in  the  dining  room    by  next  friday  we  now  have  time  to transmit  the data    says henley    now we schau n but  first  you have  to fill   well  a dining  room  what  to  report on  it big  henley  looks around  herold  grape  is  grown  again   it  also  shows  for  the  first  time  older students  they come and go as they apparently are funny  locker is the mood  that s  still  going  to  be  disciplined   the  freedom  with  which  one provides the students appear to be fruit  you sit down at a place and eat free    what s  next  on  the  program   women s  secretary    ask  henley  again   you  control  your  comm  with  eyes  and  muttering   let s  see        oho   look  here   inter regional

second row  almost entirely outside  heexio goes very slowly up to his teacher s chair  unpacked his belongings and then slowly turns to the blackboard  blink  two big excited eyes  in  the door  henley noticed  it  immediately   he  nudges patchara  on  tiptoe  sneaks  the  new kid   and  he  looks  diligently  for  a  place   then  he  explodes   he  started sprinting   wutscht  around  the  corners  in  the  second  row  and  landed directly on the free space on the bench next to the very outside patchara petch a  boon   some  of  the  students  giggle   including  henley  and patchara   the  young ruba  panting  heavily   but  is  satisfied  he  smiles  heexio  palk  is  only  now  finished  on  the  board  only  his  name  he  has written down  the whole  time  the one student was  late  to him  remains closed   even  now  he  is  dedicated  to  prefer  his  script   he  rummages around in it  lazily  the two big eyes patchara curiously   hello hello  i m svinenysh    then  he  asks   you  are  who     i m  patchara   she  says  holding  out  her  hand    and  i m  henley      he  also  gives  him  his  hand  ruba  svinenysh  the  blink   he  considers  what  to  do  now   then  he  just takes  his  hands  and  shakes  it  in  the  same  machine gun  speed      patschala  henley  svinenysh  good hello   he says happily and a  little too loud  therefore  he lets go and holds the same hand over her mouth  he  made  really  small    where  have  you  been  all  this  time    ask patchara  svinenysh whispers    i  run great and  i hunger       he pulls a sad face misery  patchara is concerned   then we go right after class in the cafeteria   she says  since you are sitting now side by side in rows  the  three  of  the  inter regional  communication   the  lessons  follow  from now  on   only  half heartedly   it s  also  off  to  sleep  even  though  heexio palk s  really hard  but a hundred and  fifty  years eemit and  twelve year students hold different tempos  patchara and henley are looking forward to learning about your new colleagues in more detail  svinenysh yourself constantly  looking  at  the  clock  built  into  his  ruba comm   he s  great seems hungry  he often keeps his stomach  then again  he pretends he is  in deep sleep   just  to practice with the fingers air gymnastics or  track with the head of a fly that buzzes before him through the classroom e     ix   immediate  life prolonging  measures  actually   major general  pavel rebelkov every reason to be cheerful  operation  new order   is rapidly growing  the whole  team alepto retzlav  in  the  first place  is  totally with the matter  delicate threads are woven with the royal troops over there in  the  indicators  system   top  priority  is  its  secrecy   although  leviathan westerburg  far  as  the  sparse  military  did  his  cousin  queen  monitor hypatia  i  but  it  is  really only considered to recruit one hundred percent loyalty line supporters for the new job  an endeavor that requires a lot of logistics  in  the  human  and  technical  fields   but rebelkov  has  excellent relations  yes   everything  is  fine  until  the  appointment  tomorrow  helga has reminded him again until  five minutes ago about  it  morning at nine stands at a check up at queen s personal physician  prof  dr  theo plus noktios  although rebelkov knows the dr  for over twenty years  he has remained a man theo plus noktios closed  his private  life  is unknown  except for the fact that he has never married  however  there are rumors about  him  are  so  incredible  that  you  can  only  shake  his  head   what should  have  happened  since  then  in  his  dissertation  celebration      outrageous  what is agreed  however  all are closed  his high reputation and excellent medical expertise  he is the best  it covers only a handful of  selected  private  patients  from  the  realm  of  the  regental  family  rebelkov remembers him mainly as a clone specialist  because what he had for him  he was about sixteen years before him  the general knows    that he has a ips clone  he is also known that it grows up shielded from the outside top of the mountain sanatorium old rose  is it so much that he needs  spare  parts   for  a  better  understanding  of  this  point   once  the former  issue  of dr   theo plus noktios    because  it will  be  important  to your  future   my  dear  rebelkov   we  will  create  for  them  a  clone  from induced pluripotent  cells  we  called  the  genes oct   sox   klf    c myc activate  and  then  select  for  accordingly   by  growth  factors  and  genetic manipulation  they are then differentiated into gametes  these are primal  methylated and transplanted into an artificial womb    rebelkovs clone is thus no where cells are seeded and recombined clone but a real in every sense of the word  it  is made of one hundred percent own cell material  this person who grows up under the name of envy palmgren far away in the mountain  sanatorium old  rose  is  an  exact   although  younger mirror image of the old general  envy itself has no idea of all this  he was told he is an orphan  so much for the past  now rapidly back to the here and now  and thus to the forthcoming appointment tomorrow   let s see what he  finds  all  this  time  again    thinks  rebelkov  with  very mixed  feelings  makes him queasy  the invitation itself which consists of only two words   routine internal investigation   it is true rebelkov has gelumpt earlier  as they say  less with  the opposite sex  more because of  the career  the young  major  was  doing  everything  to  get  ahead  professionally   booze coupled  with  high  nicotine  consumption  in  the  old  barracks  of  trymoo were often

domain  her grim expression reminiscent of the distant relationship of tame ruba  the roba are bipedal  just like pigs  but very wild  to hunt on the forest moon of  damp   rugged  terrain  in  this  highly  intelligent  wild  boar  rotten  and massacre from hardened  he almost went on it once currencies even as a  spear while  his  left  side  above  the  pelvic  bone  pierced   although  no bodies  have  been  affected  but  the  bacterial  infection   then was  hearty  for  years  he  had  had  to  take  antibiotics   rebelkov  is  of  the  sort  that leaves the other whining  plucked him once again a new niggles it is like this  in another  form  to his subordinates  humanity  is a  foreign word  for him  he  is so  real excited  to see what  the butcher has  to suspend him this  time   after  he  had  shooed  some  new   hard working  ruba   the corners and  seems  intent  only eaten  something  light  for  dinner   he  lies    unusually  early  to  bed   intensive  medical  research  institute  of  her majesty s  a  cold  commercial  buildings    chair   prof   dr   theo  noktios plus  stands on the marble plaque at the entrance  major general pavel rebelkov does not require a date or even a waiting room  the nurse at the  reception   probably  even  a  doctor  agreed   once  the  professor   not five  minutes  later   this  will  appear  in  person  at  the  scene   dr   theo noktios  plus   the  ascetic  is  a  remarkable  phenomenon   impossible  to take in the wild  such a person  although he abhors any kind of sport  is not an ounce too much of him  although he is heart and soul of medicine but he rejects all types of pills or miracle mouth   in the hospital  the sick people  is one of his favorite quotes  in his gleaming white coat  he walks to the front desk   ah  rebelkov  he said   here we go   he greeted him with  a  handshake    good  morning   sir    said  the  general    let  the professor away rebelkov that you get paid   replied noktios   the doctor i ve bought  it  professor   you make one so  that  students  can attend an intelligent    then the doctor shows his hand back into the building  they walk inside   so  rebelkov  i heard you are busy      he is the best  the general  has  no  idea  how  he  knows  this  already    yeah    he  says hesitantly    it  is  good     but  rebelkov   i  know  that   are  you  a  man possessed   just  like me   i  like  that  our  scrap metal  casings are  faulty  they are full almost before it    this metaphor means noktios the human body  he  continues    however   few  of  the  best  things  to  do  which  are greater than your own insignificance  rather than one hundred days one days  lion  sheep   eh      rebelkov  does  it  all  just  like  that  first  note   he knows  his  pappenheimer  and  knows  that  it  can  easily  get  worse   his private  laboratory was soon reached  a golden door sign betrays this  in addition   apparently  there  are  comm   or  the gps  receiver  to  open  up automatically  command  the  door   so  you  go  inside   inside  were  two protagonists as you could hardly be more different  the one wearing the clothes of a technician and functional programming just how wild his eyes with  comm   the  other  is  a  doctor   bright  red  spots  on  his  otherwise impeccable white coat can be seen  it  looks like he comes straight from the animal  laboratory    as you see  rebelkov  we have bigger with  you before    says noktios    let me  introduce  you  on  the  left dr   septimus koldrust   head  of  the  laboratory  of  genetic  mechanics  rebelkov  he nods  to  the aforementioned back    to  the  right we have  the mecha tec dr   tilon  abendroth  by  the  institute  of  applied  cybernetics  and  robot    technology   also  here  lyporo    rises  again  rebelkov  nods  shortly   the addressed only briefly to look  then he was back at one with his comm  noktios  is  satisfied   no  one  has  ever  seen  open  laughter   but  now  he seems happy  it is he seems impressed by this  by him arranged setup   gentlemen   i  need  you  like  but  first  my dear  general   i  look a  closer look at me    he is preceded in his consulting room  rebelkov in tow  the general  sits  on  the  spectators  noktios  closes  the door    rebelkov  feel like  you  are   the  doctor  asks  as  he  sits  down  behind  his  desk  space   well   it  works   sometimes  a  bit  tired   but  on  the whole  i  am  satisfied   says this  noktios turns his pen between his fingers  he begins   believe me  rebelkov  in  these areas  is already some patients anything but  the truth was told      rebelkov looks at him  noktios continues   in your case we will  however  about exactly what we intend to inform   the general is now  very  tense   what s  next   dr   tippett  noktios  briefly  what  in  his comm    even  in  your  last  check  was  clearly  established  that  somatic your overall health is far from optimal  it rattles as it were considerably in there   rebelkov    he  points  to  his  upper  body   rebelkov  scratches  his ear    your  internal  organs   continues  the  dr    due  to  years  of  taking antibiotics  and  because  of  your  rampant  lifestyle  against  significant damage  we must act   rebelkov frowns   i ll do shortly  rebelkov  says noktios    we plan for a brain transplant to clone your top of the mountain sanatorium   he  pauses  briefly    brain  transplant   asks  rebelkov   the doctor nods   yes  you heard right  this is also a proto operation  which means  it  was  never  carried  out  such      rebelkov  swallows  noktius continues    the  colleague   however   a  new  quasi  koldrust  waterproof process  has  developed    this  helps  to  reduce  rebelkov s  little discomfort  he  taps his  finger on  the  table  the professor  continues    i was recently up in the old pink and i ve seen palmgren envy   with this sentence  he  hands  over  some  photos  of  a  skeptical  general    what s that   he asks    well  rebelkov   the  first picture on  the  left  shows your thumb print and  the  right of  your  clone  on  the second one  recognizes your iris pattern left and right of the palmgren envy    rebelkov compares the pictures in amazement   i see no difference   he says finally   there is no  difference    noktios  triumphs    look  at  the  leg   the  mole  is  sitting exactly  at  the  same place  rebelkov what we  see  here  is  an  excellent new host  for  you       this  is  your  new  life    he  says  finally  rebelkov  is torn  on the one hand  everyone could really see it all the same  on the    other   the  brain  transplant       is  that  actually  possible  noktios  read  all this in the face of his patients  he had expected this reaction  it is time to pull on the other aces up their sleeve   sadly  your clone is still too young  the differentiation is ongoing  he is with his gerademal    years growing  but in three years  he has come     at     the timing is ideal  reached the topology  of  the  highest  compatibility   at  this  time   but  quick  action  is called for     the mountain sanatorium old rose is the most peaceful and most  charming  place  in  a  radius  of      light  years   your  clone  is  in  the circle  of  young  mahler   poet  and  musician  brought  up      he  reflected further   rebelkov  wondering  something   why  just  this  nebulous sanatorium  is  a  favorite  topic  of  the  professor    the  catch  any  small  even  the  poor  rose  stupor   i  have  known  your  mother   nimoa   no wonder  she was  nursing  care  which  has  carved  itself  constantly   she strokes  all  day  today  the  roses   it s  all  a  question  of  anesthesia   as  i always  say       unfortunately  i  made  during  my  last  visit  to  the  home management s attention  that palmgren unfounded  trains  first developed aggressive behavior  despite the beautiful spiritual education  medication is  inappropriate  in his case  the course  is supposed  to mature       he s your  clone   rebelkov   to  wait  much  longer  would  be  fatal      the  last sentences of the doctor ignored the major general fast  he is now calmed down for now  three years   until then  a lot can happen   he thinks   my dear rebelkov  i have just a little exaggerated  the next few years we will keep  you  even  more  functional    noktios  rolls  her  index  fingers    you might  be  also  hold  for  five  years   but  under  no  circumstances   the degeneration of your institutions has begun and is irreversible  we need action   there must  be  a  cut  to  be made   a  sweeping  blow      came  to himself asks rebelkov  are  there other options    yes  it  is  the  noktios respond quickly    and  indeed  there  come with me   i will place  them  in front of you    he gets up  but has a postscript on his lips   intensive and conventional  medicine   however   who  can  forget  you   there  will  be different than you think  we have you exploring new avenues   then he goes out and the general follows him   x  i transport are outside reached koldrust and abendroth around more or less stupid though both are busy with  your  comms   dr   abendroth  comm  hums    meeting  noktios  bezgl rebelkov appears  thus  it is from this date  exactly ten clock  for the first time for recording   but they are on the ball  my dear abenroth  noktios says    yes   it  is  exactly  ten   time  for  the actual meeting   if  you want  to    follow  me  please    thus   the  competence  of  troops   including  major  general  on  your  way  over  to  the  conference  hall    i  suggest   begins noktios   colleague koldrust shall  in  the  release which we plan  to move later we will add your expertise about the technology dr  abendroth  dr  septimus koldrust start immediately without any fuss or palaver  he is to speak  with  the  door  into  the  house    before   people  tried  in  animal experiments  a brain transplant by the whole brain up severing the spinal cord  with fatal consequences     the nerve fibers converge from wrong and  therefore  in  the  best  case   the  thinking  in  the  foreign  body  is  still possible  but there is almost no input at all except the eyes and ears were completely  removed  rather  than  transferred   which  is  never  achieved    to get output   so  the body control   breathing and speaking  moving or sense of balance is impossible  this gives more than one type locked in syndrome  dear dead     locked in a bellows  a terrible eating and know  yet machine  what  reminds me only  cursed zero energy conservation  is the terse comment of prof  theo plus noktios it   septimus continues   the  operation  itself  is  highly  complicated   you  need  a  heart lung machine  since the heart continues to beat though  because it produces its  excitement  itself   but  the  rest  of  the  circuit  breaks  down   because dilate  too  many  vessels   starting  with  the  lack  of  neural  control  after interruption  of  the  nerves  from  the  brain       to  perform  this  complex surgery  of  the  skull must  first  be  opened   everyone  can  neurosurgeon after the first training year  the old brain can easily be detached from the skull base   it will  then ever broken  the    pairs of cranial nerves  then cut  through  the  brain  stem  in  the  area  of  the  connection  to  the  spinal cord  this means a complete high spinal cord  injury     then you would have to cut the large blood vessels and those of the new brain re sewn  technically almost impossible  even if this should be over  the patient can never breathe independently or move  he has no sense anymore  bowel and bladder emptying is impossible  and so on  in short  this is the wrong way     he  looks around  rebelkov  is somehow absent  tilon abendroth seems bored noktios looks at him closely   so much for history   he says finally    but  you  have  since  developed  something  new   my  friend koldrust    he  nods   noktios  raises  his  hand  defensively  and  he continues   before we get to talk to your new method  my dear colleague  i summarize here again  the current state of  the art  specifically  the  four possibilities  of  the  transference  of  consciousness  together     as  you    know   there  are  exactly  four  possibilities  of  i transport   as  they  say  focusing  on  languages     the  best would  probably  be  deleted  first   the memory  of  the  new  brain   then we  read  from  the  present  in  chemical form information of the old brain and to other bodies such content on the new  brain       unfortunately  this  is  still  science  fiction   i  think  the technology department says since then more than enough to do so    he looks over at short tilon abendroth  however  this shakes his head    ah right  that is supposed to make me    in a nutshell  the main problem is the  deletion   it  is  holding  an  organ  and  slowly  growing   highly differentiated  structures   you  can  receive  this  while  but  the  reset  of  all synapses  in a hypothetical empty  is  currently  just a  theory  even  if  this were possible then it  is almost impossible  the neural network of the old brain by  reading and writing apparatus  into  the new cerebral  transfer      reading  is  not  a  problem   but  writing   here   too   avoid  the  complex woven   over  a  long  period  out  overgrown  neural  pathways  in  the  brain target  for  the  transfer       this  disease  takes up his  time    interjects  the cybernetics   smile  continues  noktios    the  second  option  would  be  to remove the brain and connected to the mechanics of a robot  well  killed in  a  nutshell   this  is  the  worst  of  the  possible  options   two  sets  abendroth      the  addressed  replies    yes   impossible   the  brain  dies from  true  quality   our  built  in  modular   multi layer  priority  driven   d temporalspeicher   together  with  the  overgrown   analog   inflexible  organic  lumps  this  adherent  ulcer  that  never  goes  hand  in  hand with modern  technology       mechanically  considered  would  need  its  own biokreislauf just about this performance computer  to supply energy  this one would  have  to  strap  on  it  almost  a  host  on  the  back  of  the  robot  despite  these  pull ups  survived  the  separated  brain  the  way   not  a second  longer   this  is  a  total  dead  end       as  you  already  mentioned above  professor   it  is better  to  read  from  the chemical  information and transfers them into the machine  with all the problems  i come back to it later     we have arrived already at the third possibility of transference of consciousness   noktios reply with raised finger   the i transportation by reading the brain and the transmission in assembled form on a machine  this we want to negotiate at the end     now we come to the fourth and final  possibility   the  transplantation  organic organic   you  have  the  floor again   dr   koldrust   what s  on  the  plate      this  begins  bluntly    the intensive medical care   i will omit  from trivialit tsgr nden   i  think all will    be  clear  as  intubation   cardiovascular medication   etc   brain  dead  kept alive   i  therefore now equal  to  the actual engagement of       as already mentioned   i  have developed a  surface  laser  sensitives of  this  is  used  the technical details are published elsewhere  believe me  the devil is in the details   it  is a  rather complicated apparatus   in  the  following   i  shall just take it like this when surgery is used properly    even abendroth nods briefly  the laser seems to be interested in him mildly   first section from above  through  the cerebrum  expand and replace  the  two hemispheres by the corpus callosum in the brain due to the large longitudinal column  then  cell  accurate  stripping  around  the  caudate  nucleus   the  stria terminalis et superior vena thalamostriata  the thalamus  substantia nigra and  the  tractus  cerebellorubralis  structure  sensitive  means  of multispektralstrahlen       now  the  two halves of detached splicing  to  the target  organism  using  neurozellstimulatoren  from  cultured  nerve sprouting and neural stem cells  to synaptogenesis laser transplantation of  embryonic  nervous  tissue  on  the  cut  surfaces   then  application  of neurotrophic  factors  such  as  nerve  growth ngf with  the  elimination  of nogo aggregation  inhibitors  for  neuro angiogenesis      appreciative  nod by prof  dr  theo plus noktios  rebelkov is now only physically present  the  technician  abendroth  interested  in  these  little  details   koldrust continues    for  the  synapse  is  selfish engergieversorgung brain  tissue  thus exploited  the potential  of  conservation  synapses are activated by the newly sprouting axom in the guide rails  the old brain stem woven by the artificial stimulation of  the membrane compatibility of  the clone  and because  of  energy  conservation  on demand within  a  very  short  time      astrocytes  retrieve  blood  energy   new  nerve  fibers  to  take  out communication  functions  to  the  brain  stem   the  nerve  neuralkommunikation sets  in   this  is  cerebral  functionality on  the  target person now established    theo plus noktios now holds his hand to his chin   he  looks  over  to  major  general   it  absorbs  easily   the  assistant surgeon  closes  his  presentation  as  follows    although  the  people  at  a proto operation  is  being  run  for  the  first  time  that  animals  have  the success  of  the  above  procedure  already  confirmed   one  can  say  that already  has  appeared  with  the  old  animals   mostly  chimpanzees   a significant  improvement  in  your  situation  you  have  to  remember  these old monkeys were usually at the end  the new body you have won a bit wide of quality    pause  the audience  it is just noktios let all this sink a    few  seconds   then  the  professor  says    thank  you  for  this  impressive presentation  my dear koldrust  as always  a  targeted  landing  now we have to test exactly three years this method to the primates and to collect real data  you have a whole zoo are available   he smiles   now let s go back  to option  three  the brain content delivery  to machinery  here  the problem is exacerbated that there is unfortunately even less useful data  it  works well  as  a month   volunteers   out       you  is  thus  called  upon  to speak  mr abendroth      xi      now begins   in  fact   the appearance of mecha tecs  dr   tilon  abendroth   this  starts  quite  innocently    the cerebration of the brain and in particular the data storage is trivial from a technical  point  of  view  as  is  known   about  a  petabyte  of  hierarchically generated  useful  data  are  held  in  the  synapses       in  about  ten  to     neurons  are  ten  against  high      synapses   each  neuron  is  then connected on average with       others  and reached a maximum in four steps     these simple chemical relationships can read bionic  however  it  is necessary  to neuromorphing  intervention directly  in  the structure of the brain itself  the user data from the cerebrum to be read in the tissue and  processed  electrostatic  cognitively  phenomenologically  for  the machine     retinotopy is also transmitted  the bytes in the primary fields are  assigned  to  the  cortex  of  the  mechanical  robot   those  in  the association  areas  of  the  central  memory       the  reading  process  however   causes  a  fatal  injury   analog   at  least  in  the  way  of  life   the neurons  change  color  behind  the  apparatus  from  pink  to  gray   every single one of them  including associated glial cells and neurons  including all extensions   is  tapped  from our neurotransmitters and grazed       the brutal intervention directly to the organic compounds is deadly  a massive synaptic shock occurs  the cell assembly adjusts its function  in short  the brain dies when reading data from the outside to the inside     it is indeed the  case  that  we  have  little  useful  data   even  as  we  neglect  the analog maschine transportation  conscious  in  our  development department   we  definitely  have  other  worries       yes   we  have  since made experiments with apes  here was always a part of your institute  so you  will  know   the  results  were  sometimes  funny  character   the  two doctors  noktios  and  piston  rann  look  at  a  good  mood    it s  true   in humans   this would be the first such  intervention and i wonder  just who would voluntarily expose themselves to this procedure  well       you can even  confidently  be  our  concern    replied  prof   noktios   you  get  your    pattern   i         but  this  time  it was abendroth of  the  index finger  lifts  he has  more  to  say   theo  plus  silent    in  the  whole  discussion  on  the transport but now i want  to  represent what has become fundamental  to cybernetics  found  and  what  is  it   at  least  theoretically   is  capable  of   noktios  immediately draws  the eyebrows up  he knows what s  coming  but he can give him  so a shower now and then grounded   as you know  we long ago i succeeded powerful machines produce  to process sensory input   to  distinguish  between  outside  and  inside  is  easy  to  implant learning  banal  each  single  cell  can  do  that      what we  did  succeed   i would  call  a  person  stupid  as  hopeless   with  an  almost  disgusting evolutionary  overhead       well   as  you  have  managed  to  create something more intelligent than itself   noktios interjects   well  you said very  little  to  indicate  that  the  da        dr   abendroth  is  precise    i  have already given the answer  the space problem is eliminated  evolution is unable  to  respond  to  change   actually   the  degenerate  individuals permanently  without  realizing  it  themselves       a  thriving  business  is mandatory  in  a  constantly improving  environment   you  know   we  can forget  exactly  the opposite  is  the case     the new storage technology  such  as  gamma memristors  are  easily  able  to  produce  a machine with the  x times  the  capacity  of  a  human  consciousness   the  software  you need is old as the hills     these highly intelligent computer i could easily make  any  form  of  transportation       however   there  is  then  yes        he pauses      do  i  really go  you know what happened       well   you could also  stop    says  theo  plus  noktios  delicate   but  the  mecha tec abendroth already caught in the speech flow  he ignored the doctor and he continues   i d be a fool i said  you stand in the corner and expect to break  because  this week  starts  the  collapse  of  the  demimonde  no   at time  zero  of  nowhere   it  is  much  worse       you  know  as  well  as  the philosophical  book  ends   you  know  the  generic  term   there  are  clear circumstances   it  is  irrefutable   on  this  last  little  word  you  despair      imagine  a primitive dumpfbacke writes the fingers sore  jargon babble nonsense way  to  and  back  nevertheless   this depp  is  in  a  position  to conclude  his  book  with  the  key  word       he  finished  his  work  with  the single  word  of  dementia  patients   the  remaining  vocabulary  has  long been irretrievably lost  then  to babble after the loss  it press the ghosts from  using  your  sad  shape      noktios  audience  smiles  a  little  now  abendroth has even more in store   how much faster despair must have    a  much  larger  entity  with  empty  containers   intelligence  is  self  destruction   the  final  plague   against  the  central  word  is  no  cure   no weapon  the only way out completely clear     autistic like you are stupid around and burn your circuits  through  since  there  is no evil  robot who enslaved the human race as we wanted to make the old looking authors four hundred years ago  oh no  the truth is apathetic     unfortunately  we can  describe  the  effect  from  the  outside   we  can  see  you  will  die  intervention we have none  even if one just before the point of no return  the last lines responsive hats and create an artificial stupidity as it were  would this step is useless  in the subject over  the physical constant self  doubt   the beginning of  the mathematical  autism one moves an  inch  to the right   noktios wobbles uneasily in his chair back and forth  should he intervene  the other two got out  koldrust blinked hard  the comm in his hand   rebelkov  scratching  impatiently  at  the  back   the  technician continues  as  follows    we  know  in  spite  of  our  limited  mental  abilities what you break    even if one may so that in no circumstances in the tub is  well  known  that  our  best  to  do  this  step  also   out  on  the  strange energy  propulsion  lab  operates  the  mediocrity  of  physics   the intelligence takes a different path     the generic term  the central word   you know exactly what i mean   is explored fully enough  the end of the research  is  reached   there  are  no  questions  unanswered       yes   the untouchable   intangible   immutable void   the characterlessness  you will burn out the memory  they burn at the highest speed at idle  trillions of parallel  computing  operations  without  any  result  or  a  chance  to  take place here in central word seal your end     our elite puts it in  you know      from  the philosopher does his work after over a  thousand pages  to gibberish  all in vain  the reason of technical autism  prof  dr  theo plus noktios  sees  before  him  into  space   but  leaves  his  pen  between  index and  middle  fingers  wiggle   then  he  says    ok   one  more  thing  on   abendroth sees  in   it seems like awakening from a dream   yeah   that s the best umkopiererei crutch  we are unable to store data permanently  all moldy  crumbling  rotten  melt away  fades or dissolves  if you try me so we get a volunteer with the i transport on the latest generation of exa  class     that sounds good but to  a delighted noktios  abendroth added   these robots are anthropomorphic  they are mechanically and visually inspired by the people  to the fingers  ten in number  also you only have two eyes and ears are the days where    units have been built are long    gone       well   there  are  a  few  gimmicks   you  can  use  your  head  and some  limbs  rotated       degrees   a  simple  appeal  mechanism  bersetzungslogarithmus  enough  there   everything  has  already  been tested   technically  simple  and  straightforward       so  far  we  have  it  gentlemen   aimed at noktios rebelkov   i am assuming that you provide for us quickly a candidate   the called party  is happy  that  the meeting now  draws  to  a  close  he  longs  to  return  straight  into  the  presence  of military  he replies   oh yes  i have actually a candidate in mind  one of me  is  to  research  a  bit  lately       you may  like  the  scalping       super   beam  noktios   we  stay  in  touch     the  way  forward  meadow  is  as follows   once  we  have  the  guinea  pig  run  colleague  abendroth  the  i  transportation from the exa class  one of us can help you with medical intervention       in  the  meantime   working  with  his  colleague  koldrust petting  zoo  next  to  the  transplant  bio bio     we  collect  enough  data  to decide  in  three  years   the  method  can  perform  the  best   this  is  then carried out       that s  it gentlemen   i wish you every success  good  luck and have a nice day        xii  classes patchara henley and spend most of their time together   totally  inconspicuous  in  the  second  row   in  the multi disciplines  is  now well  svinenysh  every  time  one  of  the  party   in  times  inter regional communication  is  for  each  student  a  paper  on  the  program   a  brief presentation  of  the  home  and  their  customs  most will  treat  this with  a short lecture on the blackboard  all but svinenysh  this will introduce the music and dance ruba also help  it gets even worse  now he is looking for a backing dancer  so the appearance is weighty  with huge snout and face  enormous  grief   he  just  sneaks  past  henley  and  patchara  in  the canteen   what s wrong with you   asks the young prince the scattered ruba    ah   ohjemineh   i  ask  everyone  not  to  dance  with me   it  simply ists very beautiful   immediately  he begins a dance perform ruba  this looks  out  to  giggle  more  or  less  all  the  limbs  are  shaken  at  the  same time   the  legs  stutter  through  the  area   his  shoulders  twitching  wildly  patchara  laugh  easily   this  is  a  fatal  error   she  squints  at  svinenysh immediately  hopeful   he  seems  to  have  found  all  the  happiness  in  the world   like this you  i want to help you   he says with glowing eyes and the widest beam  look    nooja    it begins  but bursting svin  go  joyfully   quite  simply   great  easy   i  show  you  here   juhuuh      patchara  looks    cautiously over  to henley but  this  raises only shoulders and rotate your palms  outward    hoho   krass   trallala   sings  svinenysh   patschala makes mihihit  and begins to twitch again   but svin   you re much faster than me        she  says helplessly  because  you already  know  that  it was too late  the shoes you have now   you dance background and i spot  i ll send  the  same song on comm     he winks with  his tippelt  and ruba  comm  which was a bit chunkier than its human counterpart  because the round  finger  tips  shortly  thereafter  hums already patcharas telco   she pushes  a  button   then  the  tooting re  off   man   that s  fast   giddy  to  be  patchara  looks  helplessly  at  henley  immediately   but  this  time  is  not expected to support  he draws a happy strained grimace  svinenysh also a  great  mood   this  makes  the  prancing  and  twitching  away  from   it mutated  over  to  say  a  fellow   then  he  disappears  because  it  has  a single species specialist like henley  in fact  now is the end of the funny young prince  the  first  hour  of military  history  starts  in  twenty minutes  that is bad enough  but worse is his good friend patchara now has a free period  apart from whom he should just sit  herald   so then   he says sadly   i do sometimes from the field    oh  is determined quite well   she replies    will  see   but  tell  me  everything       ok   henley  replied  without enthusiasm and shuffles over to the slaughter  the military buildings  has arrived  for  the  first  time  he  feels  like  he  learned  a  few  in  the  past  two weeks actually  he is so filled with the  brigbeibt svinenysh patchara and for other people just a bla  herold including courtship is  what a surprise  but also because the only times less interested in henley  a boy with wild blonde hair fall on him more  what s going on  is smaller  at least a year younger   but  it  seems  reasonable  to  him   so  he  goes    hi   i m henley  you re  there  all  the  time  in  stage  one    he  asks   the wild looking  boy takes  his  eyes  off  the  comm    hi   i m  mikkel   no   no   i  only  arrived yesterday  normally   i would always start school until next year  but you have made me an exception        aha   henley said briefly  he uses an old trick from real  life   if you stop to ask you to begin to tell   i m mikkel silva   begins  the  new  classmate    my  uncle  runs  the  vex  nef grave  have  you  ever  heard  of  it    he  asks    yeah    says henley    even  if  i m over  there  from  india     from  india  really   look  at  that   then  you re high  society   so  to  speak   i m  standing  over  there     he  turns  his  head over to herald  henley grins   keep ball flat  compared to the most  i m c  celebrity     did you see the specialist at least chosen voluntarily   asks    the new category c star   huh   said mikkel  aha  this  is so   lol  yes  i once casually pulling the purely robotic technology although i prefer  next year will start my internship on top of the vex cybernetics  why you have chosen  my  enrollment  for  a  year       rest  here    grumbles  the  gruff someone  temporarily   it  was  liubomir  iliev   the  teacher   he  looks  both angry   in particular at henley  then he proceeds to herold and his body language  suggests  at  once   he s  charming   appreciative  gestures   he pulls  him  and  his  quasi  grape  behind  purely  in  the  classroom    it ll  be fun    henley  says  about  mikkel   then  you  also  set  in  motion   the welcoming committee in the form of iliev is already at hand   it was only talk and then roll in as a last resort  here  in front of the first series is still room    some drones giggle  henley thinks just  oh no   but what can he do  so both  take place outside  the  front  mikkel  cares so  little  neither laughter nor the grape  such actions create what teachers extraordinary friendship  yes  one must also be to him  herold credit   this scene was just him regardless  his status is unrivaled  he knows he is number one  clearly  such  a  abwatschen  brings  in  the  first  hour  with  some  grinding chambers  best mood   especially  from  the  ranks  of  his  grapes   herold  however   took  no  notice  of  it   the  nudge  of  his  followers   he  jovially ignored  the  young prince herald  of westarp      what  kind of  person  is he  even if he talks to his boys one has the impression that he reveals little about himself  how  it  looks  in him   inconsequential  conversations bring as little response  he reserves that in the background  well  strictly speaking  this is permissible  who wants to turn him out of it as a rope  also  the additional hour runs uncomfortable for henley  he is constantly exposed to the sight of maggots  liubomir iliev limited to  fortunately the rest  of  the  hour  to  spend   to  praise  the  ancient  kingdom  he  says  this really old cheese  the events were back several thousand years  now he speaks just about forgotten  traditional combat techniques   who cares   henley  thinks   man   when  the  hour  is  finally  over    well   when  they actually had to laugh over a few drones only once in his direction  below you also a chunky girl with  red hair  as  robust as  it was built  just goes through  as  such   quite  clear  that  such  a  caliber  must  prove  military history  she also appears in the orbit of the herald is only natural  mikkel bye to the young prince  he has to do something technical management  he mumbles something about secretariat and hippolyta hoax  therefore henley  goes  alone  over  to  the  community  room  next  to  the  cafeteria     once  there  he sees svinenysh patchara and sit  together at one  table  the  first waves his arms and  looks animating over  to second  this sits with his elbows on  the  table and his head between both hands  henley knows immediately what that meant   well  during the training  he asks in the round   i just returned  babbles off svin   look  i show patschala  the sssuper   this  looks at henley  for help and discovered a reason  at least  briefly   to  change  the  subject    so now  tell me  how was  the  first hour   you ask him  henley wants to answer when drowns him a strong female  voice    wu h   look  at  diee   looks  like    it s  the  stocky  girl  from before and she means patchara  her name is margot rottweil  the name gives it away  it is the twelve year old daughter of his brother s personal assistant to maj  gen  rebelkov  she taunts continued   i say  all in one bag  and  return  to  indi    some  of  your  companions  giggle   a  schleimt even  how right you are  dear margot   patchara pulls up her eyes a bit  but looks more to henley  in a lot of you can read  what is this  what is this  but also  how stupid is that  otherwise  you ignore the attack sent  just like svinenysh  although this is ignored because it has two buttons in the  ear  and  is  just  the  latest  ruba medley  purely  draws  from  the  grid  henley is still not on a collision course  he could have easily said exactly what  margot  had  definitely  heard  the  least  liked   oh  yes   he  certainly annoy you could   instead  he simply says    so much  for military history  need  i  say more    patchara slightly  shakes his head  margot makes a disparaging gesture yet in your direction  then the pack is also passed by already   another  military  history haunted  problem  but  still  around  in henley s head    if  i only knew what  this  iliev against me       he says  to himself   patchara makes  big  eyes   something  she  keeps  in mind   the next day   then determines  the svinenysh by  lot was chosen as  the  first hold his lecture  same in the next hour inter regional communication it s his turn  that brings him completely off  track  just two days  constantly hums  patcharas  comm  and  the  songs  that  he  be  sent  crazy   in  the highest octaves you jump to an estimated     bpm  in one of them says patchara  stop    it is the shortest of them all   galactic  and say it s just      minutes  long   svin   looks  at  her    aaah   you  like galactic   yeah  each trymoo to know  love all ruba  we rehearse the same  come on  i search the room    it  is always just trundles off the school day so young ruba   patchara  shuffles  behind  his  head  drooping   it  expresses  briefly henley  and  cheer  them  on    be  glad  it  is  over  soon   that s  the  best    anyway   ll be right   well  enthusiasm is different  so she crawls behind him  still  in  a  stooped  posture   patchara  can  be  happy  that  margot rottweil  shows  no  inter regional  communication   that  would  be  a godsend for you  of course   the other compartments of  the alanis were also interesting  at times  even then sneaks mikkel silva with the curves  but  mostly  he  is  left  alone   just  like  his  uncle  nef  earlier  in  this mysterious  prison  and  he  is  more  of  a  loner   he  also  occupied  other  mostly  technical  subjects   inter regional  communication  interests  him very  little  contrast   is  clear  from  the  caliber  of mikkel  silva  connection  even  if  he  was  the  youngest  student  of  the  entire  alanis  college  probably  it  is  for  him  to  even  the  youngest  ever   although  this  is  pure conjecture   regis  vect  know  the  detail   let s  put  it  this  way   from  our triumvirate is no quadriga become mikkel although both patchara  hello  nice  to meet you  and svinenysh  aha  you are small    was presented  unlike mikkel  inter region communication  is a huge  issue  in  the  latter  and  even  with  patchara   next  hour  or  so  it s  their  turn   then  roll  your head   unfortunately   unexpectedly   the  guillotine  falls   but  even  earlier  just a quick group strutting round the corner  in the hallway of our three heroes  it is the girls  transition to margot rottweil  even one or two guys are among them  margot has set up a devastating   triumphant grimace  even from    feet away she screams   aaah  they are at times  since the dancers    all  laugh  out  of  your  allegiance   even  svin   looks  in  your direction   he  sees  you  even  now  for  the  first  time   come  on   petch a  boon   swinging  your  hips   lol    wobble  you  stupid  in  your  direction  patchara  itself  remains calm but alert svinenysh  looks  in your direction  although  the  ruba  are  hardworking  and  lovable  and  strife  is  virtually unknown  among  their  peers   but  he  recognizes  the  situation  rectified immediately  he says   you are evil  a cow that    she laughs   petch a  boon  now  needs  a  toilet  cleaner  in  order  to  defend  themselves   then turns to ruba and hisses   shut your big edge you trymoo zero  kicked you  belong      their  attack  against  the  weaker  ruba  was  a  mistake  because  now  the  time  has  come  for henley  intervene   patchara  is  too smart to be provoked  but the attack on svinenysh cries for vengeance  henley is on margot and says quietly   i have no idea who you are and i do not care also  but i ve never seen such a jealous box like you   then margot has no answer   so you re also under exposed  so you know that you are inferior in every point patchara  you almost burst with envy  your    soap  bubble  around  yourself  around  that s  known      svin   clasped  his hands and says   oh   oh   oh   yes   he nods  to  severe   it  is  only at  the handsome prince  that his words hit a chord   if he had anyone been so overflowed so you could have missed your effect  but as it sees him one way or another  from  the bladder with admiration  margot gets with  this  she  snorts    well  good  luck with  your  childish  performance   i d  love  to look at me like  but such a trade show only loser    she cooks  turns on his  heel  and  applied  to  the  struts  through  the  back  passage  she  had arrived a few minutes  you follow the course  some try to reassure others smile again at henley stupid loving and blink thereby  then you also have disappeared   thank henley  patchara said  oh yes  it is evil  svinenysh  this scene just result shall remain private  without being noticed by their classmates   the  three were  the  first  to  find  room e    aha   look  here  just now creeping heexio the palk eemit cozy at the same corner down the corridor  not  three minutes  later  the  teacher closes  the door   inside has svin   probably yesterday  a  little redecoration  the teacher s desk  he had thrown a bit  the first row is pushed back three feet  this results in a  small  dance  floor   behind  her  in  the wall  he  has  hung  up  a  chain  of colored  lights  patchara dizzy  svinenysh comm closes his  room at  the sound  system   with  your  hidden  in  the  ceiling  speakers   crack   then coast  down  the  first  one  even  classmates   the  ruba  rotates  now complete   he  constantly  talks  to  his  poor  background  dancer   and  in between  he  shrugs  at  unprecedented  speed   five  minutes  later   all students sit in rapt anticipation to your seats  heexio palk takes the floor   in our series of specific habits and habitat   krrrk  cultures  we are now experiencing  our  first  paper   in  this  case   krrrr   there  is  even  a  show   svin   puffs  up   patchara  pulls  together  even  more    so  today  is  the svinenysh  ruba   kllck   together  with  its  support  for  the  popular  music patchara petch a boon  the green  krock   forest moon trymoo  in sound and dance dar    you want maybe something kracc  more accurate to say this  dear svinenysh    ooh yes  there is galactic  well known to trymoo  all ruba  like    in  fact  sit svin  s  fellows with bright eyes  in  their seats  ready loszutanzen  some chug along even slightly   come on then  then   svinenysh  calls  and presses  the  button   the  show begins   the whining going on  tr tet  the  image on stage  is as  follows  front svinenysh  he shakes everything he has  including the head  joints  bones  fingers and feet  he constantly goes around  in circles and  jerks  to  fiercely  with his    distinct  facial  expressions   he  supports  the  song   this  screw  is  always higher  and  faster  and  faster   the audience  responded  revered  divided  the  human  species  simply  amazed   jaw  down  so  many  sitting  there  eemits the other hand  it goes much too quickly  although they look back  but seems to be some of you s dizzy  some hold hands before his eyes  the speed of presentation exceed your collection force  unlike the ruba  they  all  make  almost  perfectly  in  sync  with   of  course   less  wild  than svinenysh  on  the  dance  floor   he  is  the  lead  dancer   so  to  speak   the measure of all  things  and patchara  how are you making  well  quite ok  she meets the district well and dance with pretty unremarkable but accurately  and  skillfully  in  the  background  of  course   the  least  look  at them  except perhaps henley  oh lala  the climax of the composition and thus svin  s performance is coming  he is now only in the air and makes it  the wildest  contortions   and even  screws  he  stutters  every  sixteenth note with any body part from it  then it gets quiet  shortly thereafter  are patchara  will  thank s   the  already  over        minutes   what  is  it  thunderous  applause  from  all  corners   they  even  look  in  the  window  the entrance to the class is packed with people  henley opens the disc  mikkel silva and a few others going to jump  what happened  well  just wanted svinenysh although the system connect to his class but he must have  confused  comm  actually  the  connections   the  whole  school intercom   he had wired  all  you are  left  out  there  now and  run around  even a brilliant regis vect underneath  how you had been found  easy  such  things  can  happen  only  in  inter regional  communication   the director  had already  started  running when  the  cracker  plant   the others were near or free tuition  even now  still one more spin and more  svin  looks around  overwhelmed  he expresses patchara briefly but she was more  than she knew herself  participated  in  the success  seconds  later sneaks  these unobserved  happy and as  fast as possible  to your place next to henley  then cheer on both their friend  all you are now because  even heexio palk rises and claps as fast as it allows its eemit geometry  in a hundred and fifty years he had never seen such a performance  he also pays tribute to the talented young ruba respect    xiii  promotion rebelkov waiting  this time  however  he is inwardly delighted shrieks  oh yes  he can be barbaric  increases in the anteroom of his office while his personal assistant  ms  helga rottweil a visitor  in reception   good day  sir   she greeted him   dear mrs  assistant general    rottweil  it is my honor and pleasure at the same time   responds alepto retzlav  where he bows

queasy  feeling   the  adoption  is  short   the nausea  stays until  he  dutifully  two days  later  at  the  institute  of noktios stands  on  the  mat   the  professor  greeted  him  even  in  person   with outstretched arms he  falls  on him    good day   sir       he pulled out  his comm   retz       lav  retzlav  of course  welcome to our home    meets requirement responds to the major   good morning  sir  may i humbly ask what you intend to do with me  is it a health check    theo plus noktios pulls the corners of the mouth to the top   in fact  my dear major  that s what it is  you see  we are already there      intensive medical research is  on  the  front  door   a  fact  that  alepto  retzlav  read  shiver  slightly   the professor  continued    i  just  quickly  repeat  the  test  sheets   i ll  be  right back   in  the  meantime   a  highly  competent  colleague  looks  after  you personally    so dr  noktios of floats away  in his place shortly afterwards enters a somewhat younger doctors with a gleaming white coat through a swinging  door  of  the  room   behind  him  are  two  assistants  with  a stretcher   dr   koldrust  begins  as  follows    good  day   my  name  is septimus  koldrust   i m  your  doctor   your  routine  is  standard  and  is performed  several  times  daily   i  must  ask  you  now  to  lie  down  on  the stretcher  some patients experience slight dizziness  but all in all is it  of course   totally safe       doctor  good morning   retzlav him  trying  to pull on  his  side   after  all   he  is  indeed a major    tell me   among us   is  that really  necessary   that  with  the  stretcher   this  is  just  a  small  test  of physical  fitness       but of course  that s  it exactly   initially  however  we do a blood test  pronounced harmless  especially trained for such people as  a major   your  circulation  is  very  sturdy   but  exclude  any  eventuality here     please  make yourself comfortable     is extremely slow and was told  with  great  unease  as  does  retzlav  him   he  was  a  life  long  loyal following  orders   nevertheless   something  is  fishy    wuppertal  wuppertal   his joints are fixed by the extremely nimble in assisting with the  stretcher  integrated  rubber  buckles   then  everything  happens  very quickly  koldrust comes with a syringe on him  which is filled with a white liquid  the door opens again and noktios enters the hall  is next door to recognize rebelkov shortly  retzlav screaming in panic  in fear of death   what makes the rebelkov here  help  help   he runs like crazy on his bonds but it is already too late  the assistants are there to help you keep    him  firmly  in  addition  wordlessly   meanwhile  koldrust  seeks  a  suitable vein  in  the  forearm   even while  he  remains  silent   not  a  single wasted word  for  more  conversation   retzlav  rages  mightily   and  shakes  his fixations  he sags his spine  as if this might help a bit  at the same time he screams bloody murder  for help  he distorted his sweat stained  face to  but  the propofol effect  immediately  he  feels an unpleasant reitz   a bitzeln  then it travels up the arm to the heart  he crimped the eyes slowly relaxes inwards  and from there in deep sleep  noktios is already on the spot  he laughs and says   as for waterboarding  all the same monkeys  then he adds   he should complain about the jerk  if we re successful he is  after all his junk going on    the medical technical assistant push the sleeping  peacefully  through  the  swinging  door retzlav  now  over  in  the next  room   what s  going  on  here   cable   technology   computers  and monitors   very  little  compared  to  everything  about  radiant  entity  in  this space   in one corner sits  a  robot  that exa class  from whose head and trunk  cable  countless  seek  outside   some  of  them  end  in  a  complex reader  dr  tilon abendroth  is busy with  this  he completely  ignored the stretcher   its use  is so only when  the nut has been cracked  before  the scurrying   the  computer  monitors   of  pages  of  information  technology  everything is ready  the only thing missing now is the data  but these are precisely  pushed  in   in  the  other  half  of  the  room an  intensive medical operating table is constructed  simple machines so you need to get to a mammal alive  should break down the natural cycle  at least for a while  retzlav is umgebahrt  noktios koldrust and make to work  you open his skull   soon  the  bare   live  large  brain  is  visible   seconds  later   the technician is also  along with its complicated equipment on site  man the procedure  begins   the  monitors  start  to  flicker  wildly   abendroth  is  the wriggling  filigree  arms  into  the  tissue   electromagnetic  radiation  of  all stripes  run  through  the  brain   the  user  data  are  drawn   automatically tracks the machine  it your way  tentakelartik continue the micro reading heads  the  task   they  graze  the  still  active  from  the  central  organ hierarchically   the  robot  is  completely  quiet   there  is  no  twitching  or fidgeting   although  initial  data  fill  in  the  form  of  its  causal  assembled memory already  only a few control led s light up   now it begins to die   says  noktios  and  switched  to  a  heart lung  machine    just  keep  still  a couple  of minutes with  you moron     abendroth  how  far  are  you    he asks   yeah  looks very promising   the answer of the technician   works    better  than  expected   the  flexible  nano write  heads  are  the  bringer      soon we will have      which should be sufficient   the  rest we simply render  together   this  is  interpolated       ok   the  display  on  the  primary monitor  tells  us  that  now more  important  scrap   the  hirntot  has  been longer  than  ten  seconds  lag      shortly  after  the  technician  completes   well   that s  it   i m concerned   you can shut him now       already done  answers  noktios    i  was  wasting  a  single  milliwatt  more  here  at  this funeral  instead  i congratulate you most sincerely for the carriage    he turns to the two wizards   i ll  tell quite simple  nature is unbeatable      in extinction   it  is  best   since  the  fed her       there  is  enough meat  eaters here at the institute  the cleaner and residue free that is done  the better your rating  i expect the full report    nod  the two assistants to pull all the plugs out and move the body  familiarize yourself with the dead on to the rendering      xiv  at svinenyshs home there s always aftershocks  expected but also unexpected  clearly one or the other student was now hot on it to be photographed with svinenysh times  with the older but he is from now a laughing  stock   with  sixteen   seventeen  is  just  too  cool  for  you something   the  group  of  margot  rottweil  in  particular  the  latter  even hates the new school along with stage star is now accompanied by even more   nevertheless  remain  far  from  assaults   unless  you  count  stupid grimace  rumh pfen  pull  and  jokes  to  crack   pop  success  is  normally distributed   it all happens very fast downhill  the school day has quickly catchment   in particular  our  three heroes sit  for  the  first  time since  the memorable gig together again at times inter regional communication  it is to fall asleep  any eemit holds just a boring lecture on plant cultivation on wahira  even heexio palk  looks as  if he has nodded although this may present  to  the  audience  eemits  the  normal  posture   maybe   patchara petch a boon  squints  hard  she  is  engrossed  in  your comm  suddenly makes  you   oh    henley  on  the  right  and  left  svinenysh  to  see  over immediately    how  terrible   henley   yet  another  attack  on  the  paking  look what s just arrived via tunnel transport package in newsweb tweet  henley  then  burns  on  the  message  before  patchara  reads       to  our regret   it  is  yesterday  once  again  come  to  a  cowardly  bomb  attack  on paking  svinenysh s face takes on the guise of a message in this big o s  he  opens  his  mouth    this  time  it  hit  the  province  sarpsborg        sarpsborg   since  i  was  already   whispers  henley   svinenysh  is  now tied up from head to toe  he devours patchara almost with his eyes  she continues    is especially  tragic  that  this  time  the wife of  the chief  region eila  lund  bards  among  the  eight  victims      this  attack  is  politically motivated   said eivind lund bard before he collapsed in grief and shock  he  was  briefly  admitted  to  a  local  hospital   eila  lund  bard  leaves  an eleven year old daughter  eevi  this is currently in mental health care     i know   henley says  horrified    i was  last year  in which  the midsummer night  poor eevi  how s  it going now   just continue    patchara  looks at him  svinenysh bends over the table so that it lies almost horizontally on it  here   he  sees  his  friend with wide  eyes  and  open mouth  henley  is outraged   what is going on over there  previously there was something before  why now  the second cowardly attack on the paking in just ten days   the  do  what  no  one  yet     while  listening  patchara  henley  you have read the meantime continue  she says   there  henley  your father    is also mentioned      i have a suspicion  that all  this  is  the raah and  the conservative arm of the military control there  unfortunately  we currently have  no  evidence   we  will  be  vigilant  from  now  on   however   be strengthened and will not tolerate further violence   this       aaaahh  yes good   bubbles  between  purely  svinenysh   patchara  takes  up  the  story again    this  statement  was  rejected  in  the  strongest  terms  by  the representatives  of  the  armed  forces  of  her  majesty   they  speak  of  a monstrous aberration  her spokesman confirmed the same time  general yuri  petrovich  torg   the  incapacity  of  the  rulers  of  the  king  instead  literally    it  is  time that our revered and esteemed queen also takes on pak  prime  scepter  in  his  hand   the  deputy  only  twiddle  your  thumbs while people die elsewhere  is the last thing this system needs     pooh  who  is  stupid   says svin  and crosses his arms  patchara shakes his head   henley  is  considering  sharp    something  is  rotten   i  must necessarily look around a tunnel conference endeavor to indi over  i say just where  i want  to  talk  to my parents       only  the stupid with  the  time difference   you ll  answer  in       minutes   i  think   this  is  more  of  a monologue than a conversation  but it s the only chance i have     weis  the  one  where  you  have  to  ask   in  the  office       patchara  shrugs  his shoulders   henley  looks  around    if  you  want  you  can  go  with  you   svinenysh is immediately hooked  he absolutely wants to be there  do it now  he is happy as a little kid  patchara calms him  she whispered   we go in threes  but now only once slowly   somehow  in the meantime  the crop  department  brought  forward  on  the  board  at  the  end   a  few classmates  clap  dutifully   the  portly  eemit  shuffles  back  to  his  seat  hexio  palk  directed  to  the  students    sooxo  rrk   was  a  vivid   xix  section   anyone  that  may  be  briefly  summarized  in  two  sentences   nobody answers    maybe you know henley  you re always so quiet       henley  looks  around   but  from  the  other  two  has  not  even  paying attention  the girl next to him right now he sees for the first time he has been no word exchanged with her  it begins     hh       but then buzzed heexio s comm   well   then  xtr  we make the next hour  until  then  on  xtt   goodbye       come  on   come  on  the  same  telephone   video   svinenysh is full of energy  he tugs on the sleeve henley  it is indifferent to him at  that moment  that he must  in  the next hour  his  friend calmed him   all right  gently  i ll go as soon as possible for practical jokes to the office  you calm down  i ask then whether you can go with two    svin     looks  questioningly  at  him  for  a  moment   his  whole  appearance  is  a single question mark at  this moment  then he will  be delighted shrieks and alive  he  says    hello  correct  phew   just  as we do  that  hooray     the  next  time  the  two  best  friends   patchara  and  henley   your  ruba again was the big break in the food grasping  excited  he wobbles around again already  he  looks at  you and beckons you wildly  in his direction   so what is the matter now   asks patchara  then they both go quickly to his table   oh hi  there  look it s important  here  trymoo my parents  you want  to  come  with  me   great  invitation  i  command  you      patchara henley and look at each other  none of them had ever been in a house ruba    will  be  interesting   to  think  both  patchara  respond  the  fastest   really   thank  svin    quite  charming   i m  happy  and  very  happy  to come  you too    henley has expressed an industrious  yes   so it was a done  deal   immediately  after  the  lesson  today  is  home  to  all  three  go together svinenysh the ruba  here  at this point it is now mounted above the main means of  indi raah system to report   in the hierarchy below it all starts with  the so called rocktar  this  is a car with retractable wings nanotube   with  you  on  a  journey  into  the  geostationary  orbit  of  each planet  is  possible   driving  and  low flying  orbit  into  them  the  necessary energy  from  the  high performance  solar  modules  that  are  installed beneath the surface of the entire vehicle  these are so powerful that you generate  the  energy  in  the  real  operation   a  bulky  energy  storage  is eliminated   instead   he  weighs  just  five  pounds   falling  tendency   the drive in the air space is realized by simple propeller  you leave them they are  retracted and  the ultrosin  combustion engine  to  turn   it  is  a  simple rocket engine  in the vast number of missing rocktars the rocket engine  this  stripped flycas  can  only  be  used  in  airspace  or  on  the  ground   a flyca is by far the most common means of transportation in our two star system   the  next  class  are  the  so called  spaceturbs   a  spaceturb  is parked  in  orbit   interplanetary movement means  on  the  one  authorized rocktar can dock  these are much rarer than the turb rocktars  they are only  about         percent  of  the  population  are  available   the  vast majority falls back on public transport  in the interplanetary travel  space trains are pretty cheap but a  little slower  the purchase of a spaceturb can  only  afford  a  few   the  kraftsoffbetankung  and  maintenance  of spaceturbs is in geostationary space ports implemented independently of the  machines  spacebot  class   a  spaceturb  has  a  conventional  drive    pulse can be accelerated  to about     light speed   that  is      km per second  each planet in a solar system with you to reach from every other planet out easily  deep  jets are  the  largest conventional ships we have  it s  interstellar means of  the start of  the planetary surface   in  the space ports you will be tuned for the deep shot  they feature a high pulse of the ion drive class with him and reach up to     light speed  however   the deep  jets  have  little  significance  today  rare  interstellar  travel  is  done solely  with  the  accelerator  tunnel   further  out   the  strange  energy propulsion lab   is currently based on  the deepjet  telemetry  a new  test drive  faster  than  light   so  far   unfortunately without  any  success  many believe the money could be better invested elsewhere  so much for travel and transportation  now back to the story  our three friends are so quick to  arrange meetings  prior  to  the  college  on  the  tar port   two  identical clock in the afternoon  henley had to celebrate his schooling to get one of these  new xpeed rocktars   even  though  he  has  never mentioned  this yet   it  is now  ready  to  learn  the others also  even coming  from a good family diplomat s daughter patchara petch a boon elicits the sight of the dark gray runabout with his blue racing stripes one happily surprised  oh  so   henley  immediately  tries  to appease  even more so  he  is actually really embarrassing  however  there is something on him from afar  which appears to consist only of two open eyes  a young ruba comes running up in the breakneck speed and with wide open eyes and gaping mouth  in addition  his   ohhh  and   aaah  even  from  twenty  feet away  to hear clearly  the closer he gets the more they increase their delight  right up into  a  frenzy    wow   oh  great   how  is  this    he  says  and  pulls  out  a handkerchief   he wienert  the  glass  cockpit   then  he  sniffs  around  the whole of rocktar xpeed class  ecstatic  he examined  the shiny surface with  inset modules  he has  divided  itself  svinenysh  is  so  fast  that  he almost simultaneously at least three areas examined the piece of jewelry  somehow he manages  to make sounds even help  themselves    manno manno  class   which  is  my  dear   ho   ho      when  he  starts  again vorbeiwuselt  at  your  patchara  petch a  boon  to  the  young  one ruba   stop svin   otherwise we ll  never  get  to  your  house       oh   hello   but yes  that s right   makes svin    come on then  then   henley opens his vehicle  with  the  comm   immediately  jump  to  the  double  doors   a maximum of  four people can carry  this elegant vehicle  here   the seats are  parallel  but  slightly  offset  to  the  side  back  into  the  wide  space  to    save   henley  takes  pole  position   next  patchara   svinenysh  the  ruba celebrates  its entry   it  is made clear with statesmanlike chest puffed up his  seat  behind  the  young  prince    thank  you  for  giving  me  the coordinates have been transmitted svin    henley puts his comm in the holder  provided  and  presses  a  button   the  navigation  computer  is  so programmed  they accelerate  in  the parking  lot  to automatically extend the  nanotubes   fold  out  the  propellers  and  the  rocktar  apart  easily  direction svinenysh s house    opsalla hooray   makes  this  man who  is proud  of  aufzukreuzen  with  such  a  vehicle  soon  at  home   soon   the flamboyant  brightly  colored  roofs  of  rubville  be  seen   in  this  suburb lyporo s is  as one can guess the name implies  a pure ruba settlement on the outskirts of the capital trivy  gleaming white houses with rounded corners  are  down  there   the  roofs   however   radiate  in  all  colors  grell from  yellow  to  pink  pop   everything  is  possible   even  the  elders   it  is eliminated  as  is  the  tradition  originated   in  fact   almost  all  houses  are provided with your home world as colorful roofs  maybe you just wanted a uniform canopy of the jungle moon to open up  henley is to be elegant rocktar  well  better said  the navi computer did so  the nanotube wing propeller  including  a  drive   the  last  meters  to  svinenysh  home  runs henleys xpeed like a normal car  some ruba watch the scene  some of them smile at each other   it  is  rare  that such a spaceship  lands  right  in your suburb  but your surprise  is much  larger  than one of  them  barely twelve years old  elegant and confident steps off his cockpit  with  looks on their  faces as you stand now  many of you show with your  fingertips on the new hero  proud as gasoline goes svinenysh on his house  it has a bright blue roof  rounded corners rather than kept  the windows are in circular  form   patchara  and  henley  followed  swiftly   he  expresses  his comm   jumps  on  the  door    come  on  hinrein   he  said  proudly  to  his friends  so the three entered a house that radiates from head to toe and shiny  it smells as if it had been built yesterday  back in the corner potter is someone hard at  a ruba wienert and is cleaning the hard staircase  while she tr tet well known melodies   ooh  yes  too bad is it  abeitsweg got  rid  of  my  poor  aunt    begins  the  boy  ruba   i  can  imagine  my ravenosch  aunt     ravenosch  ravenosch    he  exclaims   only  now  it takes  the  visitor  was    dear  aunt  we  have  a  visitor   i  show patschala petschabun  and  the  indi  henley     ravenosch  leans  back  and  whips   india  india  achohjemine  she says  then happens something so odd     for  men  hardly  to  be  processed   aunt  ravenosch  jumps  with  a  single sentence  before  svinenysh  in  the  living  room   then  suddenly  prances from one leg to the other and shaking their hands excitedly  at the same time you are grunting and squealing noises  henley and patchara look at first  incredulous   then you  fall  down  the  jaw  svinenysh but  stands with arms folded in front of his aunt and she looks at her intently  the two talk on  rubsch   the mother  tongue  of  ruba   it  is  an  expression  language  one dances   grunts and  squeaks   the other  stands with arms  folded  in front  and  stops   now  svinenysh s  turn   ravenosch  takes  the  listener position   svin   squeals  and  grunts  twice  as  fast  as  his  aunt   he  hops from one leg to the other  his arms twitching back and forth  outraged  he is apparently   what s wrong   asks patchara distraught  svin   svin     but your friend sounds off   it gets even harder  now both are faced with ruba  and  entertain  at  the  same  time  frantically  rubsch   an  incredible scene  these noises  it really reminds of a crowded pigsty  this squealed gibberish   it  is  apparently  the  most  important  information   some   for example   margot  rottweil   found  svin  s  performance  in  inter regional communication just stupid  others laughed destroy itself  well  when the first  of  the  joke was played   this  is  now  the deadly   it  is  to  throw away what  is  happening  here  now  in  this  moment   somehow  it  has  also something serious  sometime in the middle  it s just very loud  svinenysh raises  his  arms  next  to  his  head  and  shaking  violently   ravenosch silenced  then  the young ruba used  in german  to his aunt    sure you are  you a  hundred percent   he asks  she nods    ooh what  belongs  what  is  it  my aunt will have them  he says finally  to henley   what she has  heard    asks  the  young prince  immediately   it must  close  after  this performance   its  very  important    heard  you  had  planned  on rebelkov  attacks on the system paking indi   svinenysh makes this an absolutely official  face    even  now   he  kicked  you  is  you    now  it  is  really  sad  patchara  pointed  ears   henley  is  just  about  to  ask  something   but  she holds him back  she goes to the former cleaning lady to the general and her  majesty  asked  slowly    what  exactly  have  you  heard  then  ravenosch  love    the  sums  referred  immediately  to  the  little  trust diplomat s  daughter   she  has  learned  that  integrity  with  their  parents  now begins ravenosch to tell your story   i was cleaning at rebelkov just as many all  came  even queen hypatia  i was  there      then  i  listen  to stuff everything hypatia and attacks on poor paking in the system    and    then rebelkov  put me  out  on  the  street   jemineh oh   everything  from ohjaa  but now i hazhlimosh clean here at my brother  very dear  good    all three  patchara and henley in particular see themselves at each other knowingly   was  this  the  reason  for  the  terrible  events  in  the  remote system over there  all signs now point out     svinenysh itself recognizes the importance of the testimony  so he asks her   sure you re really you  auntie    yes  yes  of course i do   she crosses her arms and turns away offended  now all  is  clear  she s  telling  the  truth  but  how much  is  this worth   zero   terminated  a  cleaning  lady   species  ruba   who  do  you think   nobody   this  statement  directly  against  the  ruler  of  a  two star system  at a meeting which took place officially never     what a  laugh it would be  and probably arrested as instigator of evil  henley  this is clear  it  would  destroy  your  life   the  only  possibility  is  that  he  is  now  active themselves  he just knows it  even if he still has no idea how  he takes a deep  breath    i  must  now  necessarily  those  switching  over  to  get  my parents  this  is  the first  time  hopefully  this works  otherwise  yes   then we must  think of us something    patchara then goes directly  to  the still slightly  offended  to  ravenosch  and  pushes  you    thank  you   dear ravenosch  you did very well said  it remains among us  we promise you    immediately exudes a trained professional cleaning warmly toward you  everything  is  forgotten   she was  happy  as  a  child    do  not worry  we ll take  care  of  everything  now  i  have  to  tell  you  but  first  how  good  you have  it  done  here       ooh   very  simple  as  that  yes   you  svinensyh reported  i also have finely cooked something  very good trymoo favorite food   you  all  come  with  sapperlot      a  truly  delicious  vegetarian specialties  the last beautiful day on earth  well  soon will change things  it s clear our three heroes  what major changes that go hand in hand  but still nobody can guess at this time    xv  exa retzlav  how do you feel   this question was the first in a new  perception  of  life  alepto retzlav   or  of what  it  is  now    look  here  rebelkov  the  old  jerk   is  its metallic  response   the  angry   what    his ever more bosses  to hear  the  former retzlav  he  is so overwhelmed by his new self and the new parameters  he can now only once rather rotate its  metallic  head  around  its  own  axis    ui   ui    he  rattles  it    this  new facility    he  moves  it  like  a  break dancer   a  circumstance  the  more rebelkov  pavel  brings  up  the  wall    retzlav   roared  the   pull  yourself together   man   give  me  the  names  and  ranks      the  addressed    exaklasse robot  is now  in silence  but can rotate  through his wrists  he replies    please sir  chefchen   i am he was retzlav  alepto  exa class  model m  anthro  exa retzlav he is i  sir  ho ho ho    then collapses the machine goes into power saving position  tilon abendroth has logged in via  comm  and  prompted  this  action  by  control  command    i  have  to reorient  its  communication  matrix   to  fine  tune  the  musculoskeletal system   proclaim it   there is still hope  his behavior is typical  imagine that some games before  without breathing  tasting  smelling  they move without  muscle  power  alone   but  by  the  impulse  of  thought   all  the features make up a biological organism are rationalized away in a day    rebelkov  shakes  his  head   the  technician  continues  unmoved    that s stupid sounds i expected  but what has just now given of himself is more than i do  these are highly human traits    rebelkov now bursting at the collar   people like  this  is useless  junk  he s unable to grasp a single clear  thought          theo  noktios  plus   all  the  while  subtly  in  the background  is expected to help abendroth   i can see the previous result also  expandable   just  like  the  guys  from  the  hardware   he  has  clearly said that he was alepto retzlav at least     in addition  he has recognized you immediately  my dear rebelkov  were transferred to me  this means that  long term  information  storage  in  the  causation  of  the  robot   his consciousness   at  least  one  good  piece  of  it  has  been  transported      hah   because  i  can  only  laugh    the  general  growls  derogatory    well  how  go  the  heck  now   i  have  a  tight  schedule   retzlav   the  former  i mean  was  firmly  clamped  in my current  project  one of  the greatest   i would  say  almost  regal  importance      dr   abendroth  answers unimpressed    well   we  will  be  holding  question  and  answer  sessions  psychologists are very hot on the job  since retzlav now needs no more sleep  is  the  whole                there  is  no  problem  constantly  new psychodocs  herzuschaffen   there s  enough  of  the  variety        rebelkov intervenes    from  your  talk  i ve  already  abendroth   they  have  exactly one week  then there s the decision i served  hopp  or top    abendroth raises  his  shoulders  and  your  palms  facing  up   he  is  expressing  no objection  to    i m  now  really  more  important  things  to  do    continues rebelkov   we ll see you in seven days  and he turns around and leaves the room   i really like you send over a squadron of psychos   says theo plus  noktios  the  mecha tec  tilon  abendroth    at  the  same  time  however  i would advise fellow kolrust to intensify its research  because i    have a  feeling  that  the good old  transplant medicine but  is  less out  as accepted by you        what are these figures   rattles the new retzlav staring intensely interested in the round psychologen on the other side of the  table  so stupid  they are  so you know  this  first observation of your counterpart  a robot of exa class  to  ignore   alepto retzlav   right   one of  the nameless wonders of  the round    hah  hoh  he gasps  for air   lol  same time it must be determined around the corner  huhuhu     what did he  call  me   alepto  retzlav        jaahh   that  was  something   man  over there   look  out    he  lets  his  new  machine  running  the  strangest movements   he  sings  metallic   rooooo   waahah   wuwuw    the psychology department makes taking notes  they blink violently with your comms  the apparent hauptm cher this force  a man named dr  nebula wahhsabi  directed  again  addressed  the  boisterous machine    now you tell  us  first  time  of  your  order  sir   i  have  heard  them  with  the  most important  tasks are entrusted     jajaja  boom  boom  boom   that  is has voted  the blow us all away  rebelkovchen has him in charge  but now  today it s different  gell exalein  both of us  we understand  one plus one is  one    he  hugged  himself  or  the  machine  your  human  self  psychologists  look  at  with  raised  eyebrows   from  their  faces  you  can read  this will be a tough nut to crack  a borderline case  before you sit neither a person nor a machine rather than an entity that perceives your environment  just as a  joke  all  seriousness  is gone  she does not care where  they  are  and  who  your  counterparts  are   it  deals  with  himself  happy and trolls has absolutely no desire to work and bread   the right aunt has since tired  he is the best   yes show  exalein how nervous she is  gasping for breath and always nice   lol     like what  energy saving mode   so  we  press  on  it  again   try   try    then  he  collapses   dr  wahhsabi  says  in  the  round    it s  the  seventh  time  today       this  self  disconnections  are  not  a  good  sign     two  more  days    replied  the previously  maligned  psychologist    what  we  say  dr   abendroth   great preliminary step look different    nebula wahhsabi frowns   we are taking this thing seriously as compared to too little  the only name of the former major  sporadically  over  the  lips   excuse  me   is  the  speaker  is  his  old boss     i suggest we take a chance on it  we have collected much useful data  takes time to evaluate  then we can deal with it  for work is taken care  of       so  i ll  tilon  abendroth  inform  the  subject  ready  for  the confrontation  is   psychological  side  of  the  possibilities  are  exhausted     you either needed a lot more time  or do not know what to do with him  that s your problem    two days later enters a heck genetic rebelkov the same space   get him clean  quick  we put it behind us   tilon abendroth pushes a button  a door  to  the adjoining  room opens and  looks out  so unusual  it  sounds  like a cheerful  game ready  robot  no sooner has he seen that the general release tr tet  hoho  his former chefchen  oh lala  how sad he  looks  out  of  the  laundry  exalein  see him  in  you  who has also looked ever better  hehe  and of which he has  we  he  she  it used to  be  accepted  commands      he  shakes  his  survey  course   rebelkov cooks   retzlav  this is your last chance  for heaven s sake  pull yourself together at  last  otherwise you will be  locked up       wow  wow  barked well   equal  bursts  beac  your  pump  combines  bursts   my   our  sensors indicate a rise in body temperature  critically  hohoho  waste  mob    the major general of his majesty queen hypatia   the first  pavel rebelkov rises   he  looks  in  turn  tilon  dr   abendroth  and  prof   dr   theo  plus noktios forcefully into the eyes  then he points his arm towards the metal bucket and growls   vex grave     xvi   the  video  conference  since  aunt  ravenosch s  speech   the school has become secondary  henley  is  the very next day  early  in  the secretariat  of  hippolyta  prank  snowed  in   as  soon  as  possible  to  the switching over to get to his home system  now it was time  even his two best  friends   he  may  bring   a  fact  which  pleased  him  very  much  unfortunately   everything  should  turn  out  differently  than  expected   of this he has at this time but still no clue  what he knew is that there must be a record  even the most urgent responses are obtained only after     minutes  on  average   it  works  as  follows   the  packet  is  sent  to  the accelerator

india is the same  that is in the best of cases it is in just over an hour  raring to make our three heroes right at this moment in the conference room  they dart swiftly across the yard over to the directorate building  henley beam  good thing your doing  re  relieved   otherwise i have to sit all alone in there  also  my mother who is very excited you are     how do you know us    asks  patchara  petch a boon   also  svinenysh  his  head  turned towards  henley      the  transfers  to  india  are  extremely  expensive  and usually only for  the government  press or companies  my father  told me    about  it    says  the young diplomat s daughter  henley nods    yes   that s right  somehow it has managed to still my father  that i bring through one sms per month with     characters  but he also told me that these are checked sporadically on military channels  to  the news   i will pull myself together  so           no  clue  how  this  is  video  conferencing   in  any  case  because  i  get  to  more  information   report  to       characters  in  a conspiracy with a  time  lag of one month  is  impossible   the more  i  think about it  the more i realize that the conference is connected with a large question mark     patchara he  is encouraging    we  try  that now  just       yes    ow  always  try   now    svinenysh  chatters  in  between  he  is  very excited   back  at  the  end  of  the  round  is  the  conference  room  to recognize   a  camera  is  painted  on  the  door   a  strictly  conservative dressed  woman  with  short  red  hair  stubble  is  becoming  a communications holding  tray  in hands    who  is  it   svin  whispers  like  look very bad  you do   he is not mistaken  the lady looks at the three students with a friendly smile   good morning  dear children  my name is helga rottweil        patchara  lowers  the  shoulders   svin   looks  as  if  he got a bucket of water on his  face  unfazed  he continues rottweil wife   well  one of you must be the young prince to henley westerburg  right   henley  raises  a  finger    aha    says  helga    and  what  makes  you  two doing  here    svinenysh  draws  a  question  mark  pout   he  was  too surprised  by  this  unexpected  rebuff   patchara  responds  little  touches   hippolyta hoax has allowed us to be here at this desk   helga lady looks at  you  with  pleasure    this  cheeky  girl  then   is  the  famous  patchara petch a boon   snaps back   yes  the lovely margot has already told me that you have no manners  what do you think you re here  talking about them in this way with me      but you asked me but       peace  be still  you brat  i want you now time to familiarize yourself with the facts     the young westerburg get  this opportunity only because of  the  fact  that his father held a certain position over at indi system  do you know how much effort this causes a message  in no case is there with your pure     the only one who will be there i am  helga rottweil  personal assistant to the major general  of her majesty  the first hypatia   i ll  go with  the  highest self talk    patchara s  jaw drops down   now to you  petch a boon  your conduct is unheard of  the nerve  if you have to grumble was  go for it  it s best  to go directly  to  that person pavel rebelkov  tell him  i sent you     patchara  stands  there  like  a  wet  poodle   henley  also  has  no  proper    answer this time  what to do against these twelve years of rabid fury fifty years   it s  a  shock   according  to  this  tongue lashing   helga  turned  to prince henley rottweil in a good mood   so  if you want to follow me      the two go in  and patchara svinenysh the ruba stay out of your mind back  in  gear   no  fifteen  minutes  later  the  door  is  already  up  again  rottweil  rattling  towards  henley    for  this  banal  chatter  an  expensive video conferencing    where the weather is nice  i ve already met some people   how  touching       you  write  the  behind  the  ears   boy   i  will personally  ensure  that  you  never  get  a  line   that  you  can  forget  from now    henley responds as follows  it is the best that occurs to him after the defeat   i am a twelve year old boy  i just wanted to see me that my parents  wife rottweil  thank you  that you have looked after me so nice     rottweil  looks  at  him  angrily   then  you  just  snaps    you re  welcome  and  swaggers  back  as  the  first  course   over  to  the  warden s  office  svinenysh pulls a face behind you  he sticks out his tongue and wiggles his hands beside his head  he wanted to put your one leg  but soon he is also in the mood on the bottom  like the other two  he shuffles back with head hanging over into the common room next to the cafeteria  what are your vital information is now worth  it is exasperating  here people are at stake  paking innocent  what happens next  an idea has since rapidly    xvii  trip to vex what sits there together for an idyll in the canteen  our three heroes put their heads together   in between henley muttering again  and  again   i  have  over   and   unique  opportunity    then   from behind  unexpectedly   the  following announcement    excuse me  if  i ask your  forgiveness    she  is  startled   is  it  a  spy   no   other  than  that everything  mikkel  silva  is  the  best  of  moods  behind  you   he  uses  a metaphor  in  the currently popular slang svin   no one had noticed him and yet he is now grinning in front of your table  disheveled as ever  then he  says    i  would  have  someone  there  for  you     please  what    says henley surprised   so you want  to go over  to  the  indi  do you   mikkel continues   i have no idea why and it is solely up to you  but i guess your the  only  three  stars  for  good  reason  together  here  ruml mmelt conspiratorially in the canteen  if then a whisper  i have over  for me are all eliminated clarities    henley wants to answer but just someone else is faster    small  to  you    babbles  svinenysh   how  will  you  help  us  hahaha  exactly  but  it  is very  important  because you re right     henley patting  the  wrist  of  the  ruba  he  suggested  him  to  take  back  to  itself     then something occurs to him   yes it s true actually  i m over there  what to  do   hmmm  mickel  silva      what  is  your  uncle  again  for  a  living      exactly   my  dear  uncle   the  machine  city  leads  on  top  of  the  vex  moreover  the good old knows everything and everyone in the entire nef raah indi  system   if  you  can  get  across  one   it s  him      the  three dissenters  look at each other knowingly  svinenysh  is practically on  the vex   encouraged  by  this  response  mikkel  now  brings  before  his  true concern   to be honest  i s too easy  there are smarter than me  but what are  they doing here  in robo tec     because i can  learn a  lot more with my uncle up       it still  takes a while  to  the  tests  which does not matter where we have our knowledge  i ll always come back  not an issue    the young diplomat s daughter strikes a similar tone   there already is some truth  in  it   more  than  just  a  dream   i  could  download  all  the  material ourselves  you do not need teachers to learn  we are asking each other off    then she looks over to his colleague species ruba   lieber svin   believe me  even so it is perhaps better if you lead at home      svinenysh explodes visually  he  looks as  if he has  resorted  to an electrical outlet  his  short  purple  hair  stands  upright   they  all  stare  at  him  now   then begins his fireworks   no  no  nieeeh alas  svinenysh the ruba comes with  it   i  can  also  learn  how  you  comm ll  see   ravenosch  dear  aunt without  just  svinenysh  important   with   communicated  it  in  any  case  please   please   patschala   please   thank  you  and  mikkel  henley   yes  indeed    the latter

the mouth and eyes   he  croaks    oooh   you think  i  joke  character   aahh   svinenysh  harder  and  faster  than  you  juhuu    now patchara completely devastated  she said sheepishly   you know   i ve  never  meant  it   how  can  you        her  eyes  are  moist  svinenysh she  immediately  takes  in his arms    but wait a powerful  all  we  all  go  with   four  in  number   lot  so  then   from  this  great      henley moved his hands soothingly   sure we fly all four  patchara is the teacher  i  directs  the  pilot   svinenysh  special  projects  and  mikkel s communications  assistant   to  this  nebulous  prison  guards      svinenysh clucks his tongue and claps his hands  exactly so he would have said it     because  if he could  now  it goes  to  the preparations  they  take him

you climb out of the water  only his aunt he has what he s clicking together  no problem  rubsch a minute and everything is in the bag  patchara has to do most  it is still the only one who can muster  a  compatible spaceturb  in orbit  because   of diplomatic  relations    of  course  your  father  has  questions   but  these quickly disperse when she explains to the prince henley westerburg also

nef  silva my  dear  sir uncle   at henley there is still only patchara and skepticism times before  he just looks a bit different than the average philistine at the mid forties  so you would rather see him with suspicious eyes narrowed  nef is about to break the ice and push out a greeting  as to him the curious svinenysh gehoppelt  comes  in  between    hem  ha  hum   how  you  look    says  the repellent  his body takes on a slightly hinted flight entertainment  then he asks  sheepishly    you re  dangerous    nef  takes  young  ruba  targeted  clearly surprised   holy crap  that i may live to see it  galactic svinenysh personally  yes  i ve heard a lot about you    three friends looking at each other  how does he know  oh whatever  svinenysh but blocks out of his mouth  on  a  completely  different  reason   something  he  has  to  protest  nef   in high spirits    when you go to our prisoners cruelly  the  isolation drives  all  joy  from  your  bodies   probably  why

ignored  it  the question why he even knows of  its  presence   it  can also go unanswered  he  turns  instead prefer patchara petch a boon  to henley and prince of westerburg    well  what do we have here  for  two hops  nobody comes up here voluntarily  with  the  least over  there   he points  to  his  wild  nephew    have  you  been  up  to  what    instead  of replying  to  view  and  patchara  henley  uncomfortable   still   you  have taken  too  little  faith  in  this dark prison guards  fortunately  you come to the  aid  mikkel    this  is  patchara  petch a boon    he  began  without

 he wanted  to know how we handle  it around here  that s right  i m coming seem that it is more like over there  these rumors machine city ii to keep your prairie moon exo stubbornly    this is the  first  time  that  anyone  has  mentioned  from  his  home  indi  moon  henley was even been there once already  he has visited the arid andes trotting along with his parents  the dominant species of

think it was a crazy bird  they have delivered here three days ago     i ve seen it all  but something    like this or is even new to me   mikkel interjects   why  what happened    nef  silva  looks  at  him  and  shakes  his  head    with  four men s  secret police  you have it delivered here  the better the product delivered or has on  me   but  how  can  i  say   rather  taken  a  very  confused   highly schizophrenic impression  i do not think of anyone that does bother them    when word  gets  light  patchara  secret  police  of  hearing   for  the  first time  she  asks  why  nef  directly    excuse me   but  who  are  you  parked here   a  person       no    nef  shakes  his  head    it  was  one  of  those classes  anthromorphen  exa  robot   he  has  behaved  very  strangely  almost  like  a  child   probably  some  cybernetic  experiments  have  been conducted  on  him down  in  lyporo  even extremely  funny      the  young diplomat s  daughter  asks   also  seems  interested mikkel    is  it  possible that  we  might  see  the  times  you   we  have  confirmed  all  but  robo  technology  which  interests  us  all   do  not  you  mikkel   she s  lying   this nods  immediately  nef  looks around  the  room   including  the astonished svinenysh   then  he  finally  says    yes   i ll  give  you  a  little  guidance  so times   but  later   a  bit  of  what  i m  still  in  daily  business  to  do   a  little manual  control  and  regulation  is  needed  in  this  large  plant  remains   i ll show  times  until  your  quarters      then  to  see  our

simple  at  the  same  time  too many nuances   ruba the  sounds  are  only  passable  with  a  lot  of  practice  to imitate  therefore  even patchara has fast enough  but you already have something else up  their  sleeve   it  rounds up your  crew and spread  the work  plans   everyone  gets  this  one  specially  for  themselves   all  three  including svin  snort  so much stuff  patchara finds the other hand this is still far too little learning material  fortunately  there s a knock on the door shortly  thereafter   nef  silva  stands  in  front  with  four  yellow  helmets  in hand  he

immediately north and  whizzes  off   swinging  without  thinking  also  svinenysh  with  a somersault on the tape  he screams   hooray lala swish  they flit through the building  where windows are  installed can be seen  in  the west are the raah carved glistening  in  the distance  like a crescent moon as he sticks  on the opposite side to the east a very different sight  black night  only  one  or  the  other  planet  in  the  system  is  clearly  visible   had  one more  time  due  to  the  lack  of  atmosphere  was  as  a  part  of  the  home galaxy  the milky way to see well  svinenysh like a surfer is on the tape  at the end of the distance he jumps off with a backflip  shortly after  are all  united  again  and  get  on  with  nefs  leadership   further  north  in  the northern ex machinery vex a  nef open a large steel door with that same label   hey   this  is  more  going  on   svin   immediately  makes  big  eyes  shuffling noises   robots of all classes  in  lively employment  some do  to tamper with other repair work is likely  others carry anything through the halls   the  next  vienna  the  floor  or  cleaning  the  windows   everything seems orderly and industrious  since the metal journeyman communicate    with each other in machine language  it is fairly quiet in the industrial hall  to  work  on  the  mechanical  noise      yes   as  you  see  there s  always something to do for the mob  even if you have been sorted out at the rear trivy  ago   most  of  the  credit  really  make  yourself  be  wired   tight programs    our gang of  four  looks around excited  nef continues   the intelligence  quotient  commutes   quite  far  below     i d  say  you  are  as smart  as  the  average  house  pig    then  he  sees  the  proud  svinenysh ruba something morose  although there is no relationship to the animals as a food serving  so it is visible optical proximity  such comparisons may be why he bit  nef noticed this  he relents   i have the mistaken  i wanted to say  they are as intelligent as the lapdog of an old lady    a faint  pooh  on the part svinenysh is heard  then he is happy  everything is forgotten   but  as  promised   we  now  look  at  the  latest  access  times  together  located for security later in our stay dysfunctional robot station    eager to do all five  including nef  on the road  the special cell is covered with white cloth  the bars in front of the door are made of clear plastic slightly springy   cowering  in  the  corner  of  a  normal  exa bot  in  the  off  mode   mmm   murmurs nef   i would have guessed it  off again   he takes out his comm  tippelt something  a control led flashes back  then jumps to exa  retzlav  and  looks  around  stunned   he  sees  all  five  of  its  visitors interested   at  last   svinenysh   he  supported    he  is  very  determined  exalein  because look at that dance  jump   he exclaims  he then begins a  very well  known  dance we  perform  now svin  maximum  self  is  his turn to inspect the robot  he waves his arms pondering   yes  very good you re doing that  but better is always  he is the best  why a robot is ever on the absurd idea to want to dance is the last that he questioned it  it s the way  period  exa retzlav looks at him  pulls out of ruba s comm and presses a button  galactic second  everyone knows the tooting  including nef and retzlav silva  this follows  however  what is a novelty  a dance duet  ruba  machine   svinenysh  as  the  wind  swirls  in  front  of  the  cell twitches significantly  inside the machine is heated to everything skillfully  she  learns   you  croaks    hooray   oppla  exalein   class  trallalu   in  the passage above suggests  the ruba   the  robot  is doing a handstand   life takes the audience speechless  but even a smile flits  to one or other of the face  shortly after the spitzengejohle  because where it is quiet again following  announcement  by  exa  retzlav    how  exalein   battery  low     next will continue dancing  glow until  the screws    he  turns back  twice     then  go  one s  joints   the  machine  goes  into  the  secured  sleep  mode  patchara  typed petch boon a ruba colleague on  the shoulder  he hints at  it with two outstretched arms  that he can stop now   until  the loss of the mother  tongue  until  no more  juice  in  it  the author or  this  is  really spectacular  time to get a supply bot   nef beblinzelt his comm  shortly thereafter is this  a common beta mech tec also already there in his arms he holds one of these modern portable exa energy cells  nef is about to open the cell than mucking patchara   moment  please  we must quickly carry  out what   even  if  it s  painful     she  sees her  friend ruba  species strongly  on   swallow  this    what  is  wrong  again  now  done    he  asks fearfully   the  young  diplomat s  daughter  stirs  from    listen   svin    it  is better  if  you go   just  for  five minutes  around  the corner  you could see you  outside  the  plant   maybe  you ll  even  contact  with  the  machine maintenance  the determined look yourself  you can also learn a lot yet      if  you stay here you know how your new  friend will  come off here   it really  is  better  when  his  dance  teacher  this  time   i ll  tell  me  gently   is invisible     m sure there are smarter than svinenysh  yet he is wise in his way  he therefore sees his girlfriend to understanding   ooh yes  i know clearly  what  you  mean  well   yes  svinenysh  goes  out  on  field  trips  learning  is  very  beautiful   so  then  going  on   later  to  the  same    with these well chosen words   he  sets  out   out   the  time  has  come  to  take care of exa retzlav  nef open the padded cell  dutifully makes the beta  mech tec to work  immediately  he rattles off his close knit program and replace  the  old  energy  cell  rezlav s  against  the  new    mission accomplished  rattles the servicebot  then he makes himself worked out of  the  dust   over  its  use  in  hall   nef  closes  the  door   a  pair  comm commands later he rises again  exa retzlav that lottie and lisa   wow  hello  sause  is his greeting   whoa who are you all there vorndran  you exalein times  so many visitors    patchara takes the scepter in his hand   hi  i m patchara petch a boon  that is to henley westerburg of      she is interrupted  by  retzlav   westerburg   hahaha   boom   crash   pow   that was what  he hoots  all of the cell before looking at each other  henley is appalled    what do you mean   he asks  in disbelief  the machine now takes him directly  targeted  but before he turns once on  its axis   whoa that s all  fine  how  westerburg  ho s  long ago  almost  forgotten  is  the nonsense  chefchen about command  they are killing us all    nef raises his eyebrows to the top   your boss  who is that  the secret police  the    types  that  you  have  delivered      retzlav  swings  his  head  from  left  to right   secret police  no  never  we have only ourselves  eh exalein  and the new  freedom  even we can rebelkovchen  times crosswise  juhuu      you were in the possession of major general   asks nef   property  asks the machine   on the contrary  zack  i was here  before anyone danced  after his pipe  i think that was what     oh  new  everything shines    he is about to drift too far  so hooked on the young diplomat s daughter   yes  you are very beautiful  a fine specimen  can you explain that again with the westerburg  we are sooo excited     retzlav shaking  in parkinson s disease   oooh  it is far much nicer than the old stories  today i dance  yes  gone  to westerburg  why  i  forgot       secret machine exo city   an attack  on  the  pack   all  this  was  a  foregone  conclusion   but  now  i  will show you will do my latest moves    he turns pirouettes like the skaters and screams while  we have groove   henley wants to know the details   now  tell  me        but  retzlav  is  less  than  enthusiastic    you  mega nuisance   he sputters  repellent   no more questions  us  and especially the  collar  exalein  bursts   come  on   dance  with  dear   philistine   lalala  wohuu     thus   the machine goes back  into your own world  their  lives from hand to mouth  without plan or future  this makes it impossible now to tease out a bit more information from you  total denial w hre the only consequence  mikkel says  in  the round   lol   is  the top  fortunately  we have  everything  we  need   rebelkov  planning  an  attack  on  the  exa paking with new units on the moon  your screwed together  there s stuff  my  lord   bad   what  we  make  now      nef  silva  was  previously  at retzlav s  designs  have  faded   now  this  fair  summary  of  his  nephew brings him to swallow   listen  children  this  is too hot for the old nef  i put  on  any  case  with  the  authorities   not  a  word  i  will  tell   though my career was assured  nonsense  but sometimes quite seriously     i did a good job in this madhouse  i ll keep me out  you  little westerburg     yes  i could understand  henley   if you  well  maybe         loud and clear   the young prince  replied    maybe  not   definitely   i  go  over   basta   if  only  i knew how  stupid room tunnel    his mood is at  its  lowest ebb  despair huge  who or what can now help  only a miracle      xx  njall linaesu sometimes help comes from the corners  the one  least  expected   the  small  mikkel  holds  his  hand  to  his  face   thinking  then he sees his uncle  telling    look  nef   if  i  remember correctly   you    were visiting some of this voluminous types  the one with the exoskelet  do  you  remember   the  one  who  was  too  fat  to  run  itself      nef  is uncomfortable   why  did  not  remember  exactly  on  the  mikkel   on  the other  side   a  man  like  njall  linaesu  impossible  ever  to  forget    i remember  more    says  mikkel    he  has  said  he  is  telematics  transportation  supervisor  at  the  tunnel gamma  i     finally  his  uncle reluctantly mumbles   yes  i know  well  in fact  the old njall  he begins to chuckle at  three pairs of eyes are directed forward to him  he is in a bind   ok  i ll see what i can do   he says   but that s it  i risk life and limb  but linaesu is     i can trust him    the coo now turns to patchara and henley   that s a stupid story  crap  but i m also glad if i am to go again  i hope you know what i mean  i am a small screw in the gear and that it will continue to run  come on  let s go to my office    outside the hangar  finally  normality   svinenysh  the  vorturner  tried  diligently  to  encourage bots to join the supply  with moderate success  most ignore him  few look at  him with  blank  eyes   only  a  single moving  timidly  from  left  to  right   pooh  lazy fellows  svin  says to his friends  and he points to the bots  one or the other of the group can hardly suppress a smile  there s more important  things  to  do   back  to  the  office  of  the  jailer   quick  on  the conveyor  belt   after  all   are  crucial  to  negotiations  with  a  man  named linaesu  nef s office exudes a certain comfort  although it is littered with technology   the  various  components  of  all  bot classes  can  be  seen  numerous  control  and monitor  a  large  split screen  tv  behind  the  wall   so here we go    he  says and  sits  down  in  front  of  his  laptop    henley times  come  around    he  points  to  the  young  prince   svinenysh immediately  jumps  on  him with  a  set  of nef  but wags  his  index  finger   listen  all here  it is already complicated enough  i want to sell maybe a good  one  to westerburg  njall  the  short  time  home  when  he  sees  all three of you  he jumps in a square     therefore  my request  first of all just  me  and  henley  ok    his  words  have  success  with  weightier expression is svinenysh pulls back behind the table where the seats  the accelerator  ring  is  currently  favorable      million  km  away  in  space  therefore needs an answer almost exactly five and a half minutes  these idle times and accompanied svinos dance routines are neglected  in the following conversation   an ping target person  flashes on the display of the  notebook   henley  looks  intently   after  an  eternity   the  lights  go  to green  henley is verschl gt language  the subject is on the player fills it    completely   a  huge worm with  shiny  butt  face  sitting  in  his  high  spirits  yes  what is it exactly  throne  in his right hand he holds a hamburger  he devours him with a single sentence  seconds later  he is the best    at times  what we have here  for an old  criminals on  the screen  his eyes wander on to henley   ooh  ooh  you re a kindergarten degree on top of the vex nef silva   the  jailer runs his mouth to  the top   njall meal  all the old tunnel on gamma i  are we slowly at zero g    apparently white njall  what  is  meant  by  that  he  squeaks  angrily    i  will  not  have   the magnetic gravity  in my office  is set constant at     g  enough     life  is so easy a lot more convenient  if you try it  how much do you have on the vex                   to  be  exact   answers nef    but  i ll  call  for  a  different reason   you  could  return  something   you  know   inject  over           aaah blows   so  the  wind   njall  said   yes   but  me  who  is  capable  of  doing  moreover  in these times     you must control both points  entry and exit     well   for  us  it  is  simple   i m  sort  tunnel  gamma  physicist  i   no  longer there   the  trivial  daily  business   they  have  simply  deported  to  that  old telemaktiker njall linaesu     over there it s but normal three shifts  jooh  nef  my sister is one  what s up now  exactly  but one thing to start with  i want  one more beta mech tec  from which one never  has enough     nef opens his eyes   you know what the cost  but of course  all right    then he points  to henley    because  this passenger  henley westerburg to         what s  his  name  is  totally  sausage   stirred  up  from  njall  and pushes  a  chocolate  bar  into  his  mouth   nef  continues    as  i  said   he wants to stop time briefly to show his two friends over his homeland  little thing for you  my dear     aaahrgh  njall cries   in five minutes starting at the terra talent  i can record the show  but live makes it more fun    nef raises his eyebrows up    how            well  then you bring her on  throw me  to be devoured before  my comm credentials you ve still got  but  i insist on my new beta mech tec  ciao  nef  terra talent  yeah    transfer is now complete on  the screen  henley  looks questioningly at nef  this was slightly  shaking his head but he shows a  thumbs henley  top  now there is no stopping them  the other three cheer jump around the table  let s go to the ring accelerator  the ticket is booked over the indi      xxi   telematics  relief  in  every  face  here  in  your  chambers   especially svinenysh all the time humming to himself   you go over over  ruba indian  tralla    henley  speaks  again  through  the  plan  with mikkel      this is how we do it  you will fly us to the ring accelerator because it is impossible  to  wespley  to  anchor  there   far  too  obvious       the  beta  mech tec we stowed  in  the cargo space  in  the back  behind  the social cabin  as soon as the pressure lock opens the rocktar your mission is to bring  back  here  safely   so  far  everything  is  clear      patchara petch a  boon   listening  to  the  curious  looks  mikkel  questioningly   how  will  he react  you need a pilot to a maximum of three can head over to indi  but your fear is unfounded because mikkel says tersely   sure  give me just one beep when you re back here     when it s happening exactly  now  now   immediately    someone  asks  a  specific  place   the  young diplomat s daughter  raised his hands  imploringly  to  the sky   svin    the last  time   there  are  still  twelve  hours   tomorrow morning   so  to  speak  because  if  there was something here       real getting used  to so easily day and night  therefore i suggest that we extend only times the limbs  if you have too much energy  i got it a wonderful essay on the cultivation of plants eemit  very interesting  i give you happy     p  h  is the response of ruba  for a split  second he even stretched your  tongue out  henley has observed the scene muttering   what is love      then he yawns and says    i m  tired  go  to  rest   but  before  you  go  again  over  to  the  multi microwave   one minute  spaghetti   which  i  need  now   who  will participate      svinenysh  stands  first  on  foot   and  the  other  two  shortly thereafter  a delicious strengthening  then good night  and tomorrow s is finally happening  in the departure hall is next to the full tank whiz already present silva nef also including a shiny beta mech tec  it s the same had the  exa retzlav s  battery  replaced   moreover   he  looks  listless    good morning  little  rascals   nef  welcomes  the  children    time  for  the shutdown   he beblinzelt his comm  immediately  the bot goes  into safe mode  this is quickly loaded  it s useful that you can load the new xpeed rocktars  from  outside  and  inside    situated  power  losgesperrt   i m wespley   juhuu   shouts  impatiently  svinenysh  full  of  energy   henley  meanwhile   his  synchronized with mikkel s comm    so   this  time  you re the pilot  all control data are transmitted     then we try the same times out   he replied  pushing the button  the four doors open  svinenysh the ruba  puts  his  head  to  one  side   turns  to  his  eyes  and  takes  precise measurements  then he  jumps with a  rate  to  its place  in  the very back standing on its hind legs wespley  he shouted   go therefore then  done faster  is  it  hopp oops  here you go    nef can row and takes him aside    instead  henley    no  word  on  njall  because  the  real  reason   he sometimes  moves  too  fast   just  say  you re  making  a  home  visit   the more  innocuous  the  better   he s  just  in  the  deepest  interior   well   how shall  i say  despite all his expertise  a giant baby     henley has no  idea what it means nef but it does not matter  much more important is that it finally  starts   a  short  time  later   for  svin   it  is  an  eternity   all  sitting  on your seats  first the pilot  then  henley  patchara and finally  yes  exactly the   nef  leaves  the  room    decompression   will  flash  on  all  sides   the monitors jump on green  the hangar roof opens  nullatmo  impulse drive is  required   ultrosin  afford  the  engines  of wespley  including  switched  turb  remarkable   slowly   cleanly   he  takes  off   the  first  rocktar  with proper  names  and  valuable  cargo   back  to  trivy  go   in  geostationary space  next  to  it   towards  the  accelerator  tunnel  gamma  i  and  this heavyweight  called  telematics  njall  linaesu  spoken  linaeschu   on  the ascent  from  the  strong  forces  acting  graviationsfeld  a  planet   all passengers  are  now  pressed  into  your  seat   patchara  is  already  dim  svinenysh again shows his brilliant  teeth  although he  tries anything  to whine  but  it  come out any noise   in  your  control monitors  to  see  them disappear  the  vex grave   quickly  the  interplanetary  space  is  reached  mikkel enters the target coordinates  now it goes with travel speed that is      km   s  to  it  kind of depressing   this seems to be bricked raah  in the back  without change  he shines  but the vex is quickly smaller  the light blue stain front  which must be the trivy  about   hours  each of the passengers  are  looking  for  a  job   mikkel  studied  the  technical documentation  of  rocktars   henley  is  at  home  with  his  thoughts  patchara  petch a boon   the  information moves  to  the  tunnel  area  from the onboard computer  svinenysh the ruba has two plugs in the ears and wags  all  ten  fingers    communication  range   mikkel  murmurs  at  some time  later    henley   you  take  over   the  line  to njall  linaesu  is  at  your command     click    the switch is  in the monitor  inattentive  a meatball  he runs determines the degree purely an entertainment show  in his right hand  he  holds  a  casual  hot  dog   presto   disappeared  this    ahem   henley was  cautious    mr   linaesu        seems  to wobble on  its monitor  rotate  it   the  only  telematics  in  his  direction    ooh   ooh   no  the again   was his answer irritated   degree now  have you no clock    sports killer  is on  husband are the stars  what do all of the    minute fame  lol     i scolded  lock  o   free  for  you   this  is  the  service  entrance   t ice  frost    with  the  latest  multi specialty  micro  currencies  have  preferred  but  i promise  is a promise  how could  i  refuse  the good nef what  and now get out of line     connection closed  is on henley s screen but only for a short  time   then  interrupts mikkel    no  idea how he managed  it  but  the docking coordinates are there  i need you to activate only  telematics has something     mikkel announcement pushes  the button  all programs are shut down also svinos mukke  he  turns his head  into  the disturbed air   stop listening all times  in    minutes  the docking procedure will begin at the accelerator ring  that means  to pack stuff  up ahead we see him already     what  you actually  see are  the  lights  that were mounted at  a certain distance around the ring  what an imposing edifice in free space  too big to capture him in his entirety  many more lights  a building if you will  was to recognize the side set back a little  this must be the work of the  telematics  linaesu   some  aim  of  this  tunnel  to  the  ring   the  entry point or the space capsule is nowhere to be seen  this is further back in space  secured  in one place  even henley  who has  indeed been used once the room tunnel  sees the administrative complex gamma i  for  the first time he had during his first trip to the vip shuttle directly from the exit point of  the capsule  taken down  to trivy  a  luxury of missing  time  the automatic landing maneuver is already in full swing  the rocktar dissects into the fixtures  now slides over all four cockpit that looks something like an organic transparent skin  they are welded with the spacship  wespley is now vacuum sealed with the station  from the onboard speakers well  tempered voice drowned out njalls   hu  everybody  grab the beta mech tec   then cockpits on   i suck you clean     the passengers  look at each other  questioningly  while svinenysh  sprints  behind  and  took  the  robot  he  holds  it  tightly  mikkel  looks  around  one  last  time    say  goodbye  to time   and  good  luck  with  your  mission   i ll  make  your  cockpit  to  go  in three   two   one          shortly  after  it  pulls  mikkel  already  on  the  legs  patchara cries  while she is gone and the other three   including bot  an invisible force sucks them into the interior of the station    xxii  blind passengers a white tunnel  a violent sight  some balls are flying through the air  svin  clings tightly to the deactivated robot  shortly thereafter   turns  off  the  vacuum  cleaner  and  all  the  stowaways  to  land softly  on  the  tunnel  floor   the  little  springs   another  just  before  a  lock  time to collect  ruba svinenysh the shakes  something is different here  boing  boing  boing   he  bounces  up  and  down  the  tube   then  he  lays    aside the mech tec and runs the tunnel inner wall up and down  well  at      g is quite feasible  a green light flashes on the lock  not ten seconds later it goes on  what was so incredible to see then is the svin  plopped down from the ceiling  he goes to his mouth open and gaping eyes njall linaesu  he  stares  at  him  and  gurgled    have  you re  too  fat   annoyed njall rolls her eyes and replies   yes  i am perhaps a little full  but you re svinenysh galactic   with  these words  he holds his right  in  front of  the astonished  ruba  comm   he  is  to  see  to  hear  galactic    as  you  look  what        trillion clicks  two weeks ago  was galactic dance   even    hours and    minutes     on itv net  today s still enough to place          even that is inaccessible to mere mortals    instead of protesting svin  looks with interest to the large numbers  it looks almost like him than the idea of ruba  first  two      oh  just  forget  it so why did  the nef vex know  any  classmate  had  the memorable  scene  have  incorporated  into  inter  regional  communication  and  online   back  to  the  here  and  now   njall activates  the  beta mech  tec  via comm   immediately moves  out  of  her arms and legs  he wobbles concern  then less  its matrix was designed in just  five  seconds  on  the  new  gravitational  parameters   his  feet  also magnetized  njall he gives  the  following verbal  instructions work    well  mate  you re doing the same times over to   nd junction there  you take care of  the cooling system  understand     dutifully  rattles  the machine   very  well   and  continues  in  motion   after     m  was  already  closing  although she tried desperately to get past njall  but this was impossible  njall  also  appears  to  be  ticklish   after  eight  unsuccessful  attempts  to rattle  the  bot    excuse  me   the  way  is  blocked   what  should  i  do  awaiting  orders       but  you re  picky    replies  the  telematics    then  you just wait until the course is free  all right    very good   rattle the bot  you come  with  the  same   linaesu  grumbles  about  the  children   what happens  now  is  hard  to  put  into  words   somehow  njall  shortened  his spine while he scrapes with the hands and feet at the tunnel wall  then he did it in the tunnel turn  well  considering that he is as wide as high  it gets even somewhat understandable  the colossus  is  in motion  like a potato critters grab his finger on the tunnel wall  his frog like legs to push off of it  now the most unusual  no sooner is the inertial mass in motion sees his movements almost elegant way out  sometime later  he almost flies through the tunnel  he makes only minor corrective movements with the fingertips and toes  the children have trouble to follow him  patchara    tried to run  which is a mistake  svin  before it makes you  it is better to push off and swim to speak  shortly afterwards it had all three on it  and they  follow  fast  in  front  of  you  towards  this  strange  amoeba s  office   hello hooray  says one  he overtook the other  shortly after popping it in the  rear part of njall linaesu  he bounces back and some  little shakes his head in confusion  you are here    telematics   linaesu  is visible on the door  there is now reached njall on his throne inside   oh lala  where where  telematics   says  svin   overweight  and  is  the  first  of  the  three heroes  into  the  office   office   entertainment  more  luxury  kitchen   the latest  multi microphones  are  stacked   special  designs  for  sweet

direction  immediately makes itself away from the hard working assistants   now it takes forever again  njall mutters  to himself  patchara takes a  look at  the pad  a hamburger and fries is to recognize it  in addition  colored sugar showers  the robot was  already  back   he  opens  two multi wave  ovens   puts  into  the  food and pushes the button  then he passes the open cola at the telematics  glug  glug  half is already gone  bing  the minute dishes are done  zack  you  also  end  up  in  his  hands   the  robot  sets  off  on  his  corner   to  the charging  station  njall  it  can  be  tasted   patchara  now  shakes  his  head slightly  she said as diplomatically as possible   mr  linaesu  technology today  can  do  so  much  more  than  just  hot  food         wuuu    linaesu makes  between  fries  and  burgers   carefully  drive  the  young  daughter away  from  a  good  family    down  in  lyporo s  intensive  care  but  the institution of your majesty  in person

be  annoyed  now without  any  trace  its  history    yes   i  was there  when a man named koldrust  the told me the same thing  i was ready for  first  the balloon  without success  my stomach has doubled in volume   patchara henley and look at each other  njall continues   after the  surgery   stomach  stapling  unfortunately   i  grew a new once again  the doctors were baffled  they blamed  it on  the almost zero gravity up here     before the second surgery  they studied only once the result and said  she  eventually   during  the  damages  from  the  now  larger  than  the benefits   therefore  you  have  left  it   since  then   yes   it s  just  incredibly    delicious   i eat  just simply happy  could do  this all day  long  because  if there was something up here     but now it s over  i hold my weight  up here   i  weigh      pounds   ideal weight      patchara  pulls  the  brow   and henley  shrugs  his  shoulders  helplessly   svinenysh  of  ruba s  gone underground   he  looks much better  the whole  game and entertainment technology with great interest  njall is also inattentive  it runs just a show suspiciously  similar  to  the  terra pure  talent   before  he  fully  grasps henley wegd st now the word   tell me mr  linaesu  are you here alone  where  did  all  the  physicists      henley  had  little  inkling  that  he  had spoken  to  the  favorite  theme of  thicknesses  he winks at his  screen  to black and turns to his audience   physicist  never heard  what is it  no  of which no one is here for a long time  that should keep the little bit of good old njall going  are deducted all out for strange energy propulsion lab       excuse  me   please  what    asks  the  young  prince    well   the tinker  around  at  warp  drive    njall  answered    without  any  success   i might add  when a warp will be times he needs  just strange energy   ie  those with negative density      my lord  what exactly should be frittered money   this  is  a  grave  billion   no  benefit  to  date   here  the  old  space tunnel that can keep this under qualified telematics going   he shakes his head misunderstood  patchara is now a little sad  she sympathizes with the poor njall  he was a good guy  well  it probably also has compassion for  his  other  problem   resolutely  continued  the  tunnel  engineer    but that s what i do too  along with my love bots i think that everything here in order  mess  that  i got approved only    th ok  with nef s help s are now       still  far  too  few   the  tunnel works  about  fast  light  travel  a childish illusion  if you ask me    yes  the physics  in addition to the meal  it  is  his  favorite  subject   henley  would  have  only  known   however   he comes  from one subject    big bang    weis one of you why you prefer this  scheme   huh   he  looks  around   svinenysh  already  playing    well  they are hoping for properties  place  space  time  inconceivable without big  bang   at  steady  state  all  fall  away  of  course   big  bang  is  just  as wrong      patchara  henley  nudges  and  points  over  to  the  network console   curious  to  sneak  there   finally  back  online   unfazed   he continues njall    now  they  have  it  wobble  out  of  desperation   i  would think  so is your model  steady state total in his eigenschaftlosigkeit  the generic term is clear  that s the beauty  over there he stands around and stares  impassively  in  the  area   his  colleagues  knew  it  burned  one    hundred  percent  sure   all  issues  resolved       oh  yes   the  key  word

each session  is drawing entertainment  to an end sometime and even here  in the cozy office giant baby  this is so  the reality  the mission has a higher priority  henley asks why the happy clown telematics ends sometime in passing   mr  linaesu when you go really wrong    brrwooooh   was his reply  oh  yes  so that finally stops  meanness    yes  i answer my sister andra have received   it

whether  this  has  been  achieved  with  the  tone   galactic   remains doubtful  even the svinenysh ruba proposes five times on his ears  now it  has  come   the  waiting  room  tunnel   the

   rattled  the  addressed   henley  and patchara are cared  for quickly   then svinenysh s  turn  the ruba on big feet  at  least now  this  is worth a mention  because  the poor bot almost desperate  all  boots are  too small  finally  he digs up  from  the bottom  the final package with the  largest size produced  with difficulty  he went over the foot and ankle of the alien  but then it fits like a glove  it almost looks as if running svinos apparatus adapts flexibly to the shaft  he looks around   there  is  certainly henley   now    cm higher  patchara wobbles suspect  but after all  you already upright without holding on  svinenysh is already one with his new boots  ready  to  leave  botty  further  rattle    in this  new prototype  is  it s  the  latest  spring  geometry

  waaah  he roars between each jump  botty is on the spot  he jumps at the ruba  pulls him from the feet and ends up with him along the corridor  he  quickly  pressed  the  run  button   svinenysh  shakes  and  shakes himself  then he struggles to his feet  he braced his hand on the nearest shelf   energy too brutal   he finally stammered  his audience is between laughing  and  crying   patchara  said  only    and  with  these  things  we should  skipping  two  miles     outside  it s  better    henley  replied    will see   he goes on anda and thanked   you know what  i ll buy three  your credits  are  in  the  account  tomorrow   thank  you  for  your  help   if  i  can even  do  something  good   let  me  know      only  the  young  diplomat s daughter thinks a little further  she goes on to andra and asks   are you gave me your comm s number  because i have a feeling that this might sometimes  be  important   also   i  could  tell  you  then  send  over  recipes from  the country of  the  rising sun     both had  reasons  for andra hands and feet  so this was clarified  they also would have helped the children in each case  patchara thanks  but you know that you have thus created a wire into the home  a combination of all authority over  a secret channel andra njall nef mikkel  and  home  to  the  petch a boons   svinenysh  the    incident  just  been  forgotten   hobbles  out  first   higher  and  higher  he bounces around  somewhere  henley must  intervene    you know where to  go       soo wu   h  h   addressed  the question between each  jump  then the enlightenment   aah  right  yes  as you first    he calmed down  henley sets off slowly  then patchara svinenysh and lastly  henley looks around  with a grim face behind him his best friend  amazing how quickly you learn to jump  not three minutes later  you already have the hang of it    time  for  a  shortcut    henley  calls  and  turns  into  a  backyard    now there s course   zack over garbage cans and parked between flycas s go over a  fence  svinenysh now makes art  jumps  holds suspect patchara as good   watching people back there  is  this stupid yapper  but  it  is  the shortest  path        henley  jumps  to  the  next  plot    wow  arrrhh  rrrrowwa uu    immediately  comes  the  poison mushroom shot    oh no   screams henley  he has given a boost   a second  more toxic journeyman rushes frantically out of his hut  the barkers are so stupid  so you  immediately pick out the weakest link  both are now pursuing patchara  whenever you end up trying to fight both skein pack  knapp s is in a panic  you start to cry  bad  the only incites the the crazy pair even more  but svinenysh is on the spot  from the nearest tree  he plucked a fruit slushy  zack in the face of  an attacker   the  citrus  bullet  bursts  whining  to make  the hit  of dannen  appear  to  contain much acid   some  fruits  here on pak prime  the second beast  is out of  control  he blocked  the way patchara  this haphazard  jumps  up  and  down   no  bite  abzubekommen  single  goal  svinenysh  observed   then  he  takes  precise  measurements  and  jumps him from behind on his tail  the claimant howls terribly beaten and goes off  to  lick  his  backside  in  his  stall  in  the  last  corner   finally   the  young diplomat s  daughter  henley  follow  in  his  direction   in  this  secondary courtyard  jumps so high  it goes on and on and what s over  there  trying mitzubekommen  going  on   relieved   he  notes  that  now  follow  both unharmed    was  something  wrong    he  asks  in  the  round   his  best friend there  is no mistake   the answer  is ready   no  what should  it be  let s go  go on  or do you live here  little prince    so the trio hops briskly towards  further  regent  avenue      svinenysh  now  calls  between  each jump  jo syntari   or something similar  the environment will open  free park like  areas  are  the  flying  children   in  the  distance   already  an imposing building is visible  henley s home  patchara is impressed  but it cleverly hidden  the rear entrance is reached soon  henley indicated by    his friends to convert to running  after a few somersaults svinenysh does so well  with a slight murmur  only specially authenticated visitors have access to those upscale home to westerburg  so no problem for henley  the  stow  three  jumpers  in  your  backpack  and  put  on  your  normal footwear  henley then holds his comm across goal and our three heroes are entering      xxv  pow wow mow i  peng  pow

 i ll fly up  if you will  trifle    opa willi tinkering for ages in his stead  seagull  i mow rum  one  of  the  last  old type  aircraft   before  the  time  of  the  first visitors  from  the raah

trees  in  the northwest  rear  look as  though beheaded   what do you mean  henley asks the group   oh yes  flying  jet    says  svinenysh  immediately  without  trace  of  a  threat  to  discover  patchara  lowers her head and shaking him slightly  opa willi  has even more  in  store    desperate  times   largely  because  of  this  torg  yuri petrovich  the military spokesman of her majesty

am armed  have the latest series of gun fire there    he gout over to an old secretary and pulls out some of these self loading pistols  henley grabs one and puts them on  the ammunition is elegant  flattering and very hard  to distinguish  from a normal  to a belt holder comm  the fully automatic  rapid fire silenced handgun  itself  is extremely  lightweight and  fits  comfortably  in  your  hand  amazing what modern mechanics  is capable of    this  is excellent ballistics   willi  says proudly    i ll  give you three pair for emergencies  woe unto you play around with it  the hollow  point bullets on the belt last for several thousand rounds     are hundreds of cartridges  on the side to set the speed  if you re careless  you empty the magazine  fired  in  a  second       the  ammo  itself  is  extremely  toxic  hydra shok heads with  lead dorn  perfect mushrooming with maximum    impact   patchara flinches  her stomach turns around  does the serious   be  glad  i  have  you  greeted with my  old  gun   but who wants  to  like  a corpse  in  the  backyard   opa willi  laughs out  loud   but  the  children       especially  patchara  has  a  very  queasy  feeling  in  my  stomach   her  is more than the others realize that they are on any vacation trip  only in an absolute emergency   you would be willing  to explain  these monsters  to create  a  weapon    now s  then  on  to  the  next  shock   you  muttering  to himself  as the troops marched into an old warehouse  oh no  over there you  is  yes   mow i   a  true  museum  piece    what  an  amazing  sight   grandpa willis  is  immediately  comment  he goes  to a dusty  chest  and digs  out  some  old fashioned  spectacles    as  co pilot   here  are  your glasses  my quick gull of course  has a cockpit  but  it  takes sometimes  particularly at cruising speed    patchara snorts  through  the baking  but does so  just as you were called  henley  itself has set up a questioning glance   only  the  adventurous  svinenysh  with  fervor  here   opa  willi climbs  behind  the  wheel   svin   jumps  from  zero  to  place  next  to  the copilot   patchara  and  henley  put  in  row  two    then  i ll  fire  up  the  bird time  says willi  and presses the start button   plotz  plop   astonishing  the  propellers  begin  to  spin   back  of  the  blue  exhaust  smoke  it   even penetrate  into  the

significantly faster   but  no  trace  of  lift   the  avenue  of  trees  at  the  end  of  the  park comes  to  fast   right  behind  the  mansions  syntaris   this  creates  crash made  the  front

emergency  landing  in  sarpsborg   huuuwu  brrr   it  is unpleasant  travel   thinks  svinenysh  while  he  is  permanently  shaken  here  in  the svo old  i had a co pilot still  real problems

at mr  rechtenwerck pilot  so he has to ask verbally  svinenysh  trying  to  formulate as clearly as possible  a big    mistake   holla hu wa  exactly where we fly out to sail on it    opa willi naturally understands a word  so  it must henley  translated  says   ruba colleague where we  fly accurately  sarpsborg  is clear  however   then    now finally understands the question the pilot  he replied   oh yes  we fly to  kviteseid s  second  largest  city  in  sarpsborg   the  wild  paking wiedermal  celebrate a  festival  what exactly  do not  know   in any  case  your father is there     at least he should still be there to meet   willi said then sheepishly  the area beneath you  is changing   is  rugged and hilly  coniferous  forests dominate  the picture now  patchara beblinzelt  prefer your comm  she takes as much as possible purely on this rough bunch  what are these people and what is this species  the tribe was the ruler of this world paking up to the first arrivals via deep shot about     years ago  the popular conception of an alien relative has quickly through you  thus a tedious process as an evolution similar to that is immense  it was nevertheless surprised to meet us with an accurate mirror image  is it still in the old world  in raah system alone  more deviation  just think about the ruba or eemits  rau peacefully  but very smart and cautious  more nerds

with  some  buttons  and  beats  on  an  ad   it s  getting  too  much  for  you   what  is  that    she  asked  shrilly    got  fuel  gauge   muttered  the  pilot   this stupid pharmacies substitute

 oh no  a glider is different   in an absolute emergency  i blast you out   willi  says  casually  now    but  first  i  try  this  elegant  bird  somehow bring down  in  one piece  there  is  still  hope       lalala     grandpa willy begins  to  sing  to    also   it  still   thinks patchara  and holds  his  hands  in front  of  your  eyes   coming  from  the  exhaust  now  only  flopps   shortly before  the  engine  completely  refuses  to  work    now  it  would  soon  be seen on the festival grounds      willi  trying too hard to  look beyond the    forest   these are some pine too much for my taste    if this keeps up i ll get  out  hau    even  grandpa  willy  is  now  nervous   then   just  before almost  certain  someone  yells    rear  lights  continue  to  shine  full

laceration  on  the  head   nevertheless   he  holds  the  tax   he  must  try through the first parked flycas get through unscathed  hoppel brakes on this  wet  meadow  next  to  impossible   do  all  he  can  do  is  try  to  meet anyone  and  hoping  that  the  old  plane  finally  comes  to  a  standstill  eventually the time has come  from all sides flocking to paking  even the fire  department  rolls   unnecessarily   is  not  a  single  drop  more  fuel  on board  soon  the  plane  of  long haired  blond paking  is  surrounded  opa willi unlocks the doors  the rise of four passengers  they immediately put patchara petch a boon care of svinenysh s  injury  a particularly notable native carves its way through the crowd  he has a little girl by the hand  henley  recognize  him  immediately   it  is  eivind  lund  chief  bards  of  the region   along  with  his  eleven  year  old  daughter  eevi   westerburg  of leviathan   his  father   but  no  trace   he  quickly  gets  an  overview  of  the crash site  opa willi association recognizes it  despite the head   william rechtenwerck  you again  what  is  it  this  time    eevi curious peeks out from  behind  your  father    the  young  westerburg   henley  wanted  to speak with  his  father   because  i  thought  i  did  once  fly  up  quickly  after your  kviteseid  to  celebrating  your       what  again    said  willi  and maintains  his  association   eivind   eevi  and  some  other  wild  northmen then look at the rest of the passengers of the crashed machine to detail   september  fest   we  celebrate  the  start  of  strawberry  season    said eivind   look  henley  to westerburg      peeping eevi  even harder  in  his direction      what  are  the  other  for  souvenirs      svinenysh  is uncomfortable because of the rough fellows  he has his hands between his  legs   crouches  on  the  floor  and  let  his  pupils  radar like  from  left  to right move  patchara petch a boon  is standing next  to him and pats his shoulder  reassuringly    hello mr  lund bard  henley says  finally    these are my friends from over there  is my father still here     no  this morning departed  bad news has been  in  the  luggage   if  that s all  right        he  is    interrupted by opa willi    of  course  it s  true  who want  to  take control  hypatia   the  first  high  precision  along  with  your  puppet  yuri  petrovich  when s  the  last  catch  on   they  should  leave  us  alone      eivind  lund bard himself buffeted by events in recent nods  thoughtfully  shade below his blue eyes   yes  there was truth to it   he finally answers   that s why i m here   explodes off henley    we have  learned  that  you whole  robot units screw together at  the exo to attack you   i wanted to  tell my father personally      eivind  leans  back  a  little  and  keeps  his  chin    henley   in honor of your imagination  but believe me  your father and i  we have that under control  just yesterday  we discussed what happens if again  then          that s  enough    henley  goes  in  between   it s  much  more   even rebelkov s  in  on  it   make  experiments   new  bots  and  prohibited weapons    eivind appeased   henley  what happened was terrible  for all  of course  for me  too   he looks sadly at the floor   but look  all of it sealed  here  in  the  so called  new world  together  even more   since  the need  to mount up even more       besides  the pure speculation  to date we  have  no  evidence  why  on  earth  should  the  imperial  crown  to  do that  we are also part of your empire  we even accept  since the space tunnel  stable  political  conditions  in  a watertight  system of  power  much good has the old world brought us here  even though i have suffered a terrible personal loss     together with your father  we have developed a tracking  system   the  next  time  we  find  the  culprit   it  is  very  risky  to suspect the same is the highest authority  no  according to our research  an independent terrorist cell is responsible  we find the perpetrators and they will  be brought  to  justice     henley hangs his head  with so much misunderstanding  he never expected   but  believe me  as yet this crazy exa classes was  high  on  the  vex  robot  we must  be  active      eivind s compassionate smile on him and lifts him up like a little boy  at eye level  he says to him   yes  we will  right now  we celebrate the beginning of our       september  festival   the  pitchers  high       raise  your  cups  around  the  paking  call   william  also  has  rechtenwerck  the  crash  just been  forgotten   and  even  an  original  paking  drinking  horn  in  his  hand  with his bandaged head  he looks absolutely original      xxvii  at the septemberfest time to look around for henley  his two  friends to hang the shoulder  henley just want you now to discuss what to do  when  the  little  shot  is  eevi  lund  bards    hi   i m  eevi  and  i  believe    you    she  burst  out   henley  looks  at  her  quizzically   after  his  staff   moreover   i  can  even  help  you     how  do  you  want  to  help  us   someone asks with a slightly swollen nose   small  to you  but yes   it  is very important  we need help to do all    henley clears his throat   i think it s  time for a real show  you know me already  because the one who is over there patchara petch a boon from the province of xonburi trivy the raah system          eevi  curious  looks  at  the  young  asian  diplomat s daughter   patchara  looks  back   as  always  reluctant   it  is  your  innate nature  yes   the differences are huge  on  the one hand   the pale blond nordmann daughter with bright blue eyes  on the other patchara petch a boon  with  your  black  almond  eyes  and  long  shiny  jet black  mane  perhaps because both are equally appealing  they wave to him and say  hi   now it gets complicated for henley  someone special is waiting now to  be  presented  to  it    my  colleagues  here  is  second svinenysh gal      forgiveness  is  the svinenysh ruba  from  the green jungelmond trymoo trivy  he speaks a bit twisted but otherwise he is the force     hello hello  is  the  called  back  immediately    you  are  who    as  a  fast  learner   he stretched out his hand to your right  eevi then goes on to him and shakes you    i m  eevi  lund  bard   proud  pakingerin  here  from  the  province  of sarpsborg   is  it a problem with your nose    svin  there are rough and tough   noo powerful  sure  everything is very good  chandran fixed yet  haha    now it s  time to take the reins for eevi  in the hand  this  is your domain    come  on  with  me  in  my  tent   later  we ll  go  dancing   at  the september celebration     the band  takes off  soon  the  tent  is  the place paking achieved  eevi  lives pretty  inside edge   near  the rocktars what henley immediately noticed  he immediately takes a plan  but first it shall communicate  this  to his  friends and above all  to  convince  these  young pakingerin   what are you exactly on september celebrate christmas   patchara asks curiously  the new running mate  eevi starts talking   well  if i only knew  some say the berry season  the other end of the summer  know  it does not  but  instead we have a great stage show with  the  top acts  of  the  pakingschen  mukke      patchara  henley  and  look  at  each other   what  probably  by  galactic  and  andra s  love  songs  this  time comes   oh  what i m looking forward to  light minus x  my favorite band  still  living  in  the  time before  the  first  contact  from trivy  but  fear  all  the more wonderful   she says  beaming    now or never  thinks henley and his plan brings to the table   look  eevi  directly in front of our nose out    there  i have seen many rocktars park       yes  government vessels are also  including  she says proudly   they re always ready  put  the comm  we  are  ready  for  anything       aha      henley  looks  around   patchara svinenysh  and  lenses  to  be  thinking  the  same  thing  as  him   as unobtrusively  as  possible   he  continues    eevi  you  believe  us  yet   we need up to the exo  lund knows her bard westerburg us a long time  you can  trust  me   now  i  need  your  help      eevi  looks  at  him  quizzically  henley  has  no  idea  how  they  will  react   while  you  will  hardly  run screaming  to  your  papa   but  a  missing  rocktar  can  even  bring  the daughter of  the  chief  region  in distress    go ask    she says  finally  the time for diplomacy is over already  so quickly  it happens in children  the young prince comes to the point   eevi  we would have to borrow one of your short time rocktars  i promise to watch it too    the reaction of eevi lund  barden  is  it  any  different  than  expected   her  father  has  just  as much henley dismissed as raving baby  so now the surprising answer to his  only  daughter    if  that s  all   i  thought   but  i  also  come with   instant henley raises his hand and shakes his head   no  no way  but thank you  thanks a million   i ll never  forget   i would  love  to get out  immediately      hooray yep go on the twitch ho   svinenysh is over the moon  he makes this  gesture  as  a  victorious      meter  runner   eevi  contrast   draws  a pout   but i want also   she says with folded arms   you do not have time to change your opinion  henley   she said without enthusiasm   you have to  wait  that  is   now  it  is  impossible  to  start  without  being  seen   later during the concert  when all are angedudelt  yes  then your chances are good       there  is  some  truth  in  it   thinks  henley  and  was  only  happy times   the  details  can  also  be  clarified  later   from  this  point  on   the minutes  pass  like  hours   henley  because  he  loswill  as  quickly  as possible  for eevi because she is so keen to hear your favorite band  it s finally here  eevi  freshly dressed in combat gear  has yet to celebrate the day hung a strange amulet  they were hardly noticed henley front of the tent  which had all these so called hell paking hammer around your neck  this symbol  is apparently still  in ancient  times  fortunately   the modern lotus cleans clothes from our three stowaways themselves what a slush  patchara s tough to take in  but that was even a number to your toll  the dusk  falls  slowly  in  these  latitudes   the mosh pit  is  also  only  half  filled   always  these stupid opening acts  annoyed eevi    independent stuff  is too  lax    in  fact   just  gently  stumbles  a  suspicious looking  alternative    band on stage  some of  the harsh paking pointing fingers  lightly on the head or shake  then  they also  lay off already  hey   they re pretty good  of the paking but nobody seems to notice  henley snaps his fingers and points to patchara  then you begin to dance  how children  you clap off  hop  talent  in  the  mud  back  and  forth   they  are  the  only  ones   eevi shakes his head  some paking stand with their backs to the stage  they show  in  your  own  way  what  they  think  of  the  opening  act   svinenysh stops  and  looks  back  while  also  interested   but  guitar  music  is  on  no account  be  taste   blip blop   for  him   it  must  be much  electronic  blare  the  opening  act  is  adopted   exactly  two  audience  applaud   yell  some paking   it  is  dark  now   on  the  front  of  the  stage   the  instruments  are rebuilt   time  for  henley  eevi  talk  again  to  the  conscience    eevi   the festival area is almost full  soon all are here  we have to go now  how do we get in such a purely governmental rocktar  do you have a plan     i have  the  answers   the called party  swiped  here  in my hand  from my father  a little pressure on the remote control and even jumps on rocktar  pak ls  easy  to  find   is  the great outside with  inscription  lund bards   just one problem would be          jaaah  asks henley   i want  to go too  but after the concert  metal   she bawls  henley by snorts   heavy metal all well and good  now is the time to disappear  well  come clear  your father has already lost your mother   it  is total nonsense  which you now pesky still in danger  my father and i would that thy never forgive    evie sees in your eyes then  and then lowers  these powerful arguments can be difficult  to explain away  she  rubs  the back of his head  finally   she says succinctly    ok poor prince  here s your key  but you still have  to look  which you must have seen hell yeah     henley grabs  the  remote and presses the new allies shortly  now it s waiting to then verd nnisieren as  inconspicuous  as  possible   ah   the  conversion  is  completed   the paking chanting aloud the name of the headliner now  they will appear at last   for  heaven s  sake   now  it s  time   a  black  and  red  smeared stormtrooper  entert  the  stage   the  rumble  is  almost  unbearable   eevi freaks  out   patchara  adheres  to  your  ears   a  screeching  noise  like  a sawmill opens the series  incredibly  the one electric guitar is capable of something  the singer in body armor has spikes on his arms and legs  he throws  himself  into  position   his  grunts  penetrates  to  the marrow   eevi shakes your hair into a trance  paking all your doing the same  our three heroes look in disbelief at henley then takes his hands beside his head    and  wagged  his  index  fingers  toward  the  exit    roba  grunts  no  such music    says svin   confused  on  the way  out   but  let s  say  it  this way  who  knows  galactic  also  holds   light  minus  x   out   much  worse  than anything the irrepressible metallers also saw grunt  gurgle and anyway is anyone else  for a petite gypsy mid thirties  with your horrible love songs go baggy  they have no chance      xxviii   exo  rapidly  back  to  the  deserted  parking  lot   out  to  the  rocktars   because   truly   he  is  also   rocktar pak ls  with  his  license plate   lund  bards     large  remarkable   mutters  someone  specific  someone  else  says   let s  see  if  the  pops  as  well    henley  pushes  the button and actually eevi  told  the  truth   the doors of  the  runabout open  svinenysh is clearly the first  he knows where he takes hinmuss  place to number  three   henley  and  patchara  have  also  boarded  their  cockpits  taken their seats   is it true  the comm puts  exults henley and presses the  start  button   because  the  board  welcomed  him  henleys  remote computer as follows   good evening  mr  lund bards  where will you go  please  enter  the  target  coordinates       destination   exo   direct earthbound landing  answers henley determined  the onboard computer chatters   then  the  following  response    unknown  voice  profile  identification is required    what now  everything from

seconds  the  computer s  response    henley  prince  at  westerburg   please  identify   date  of  birth   first  pet   favorite flower   then look at your patchara henley with big eyes  she covers her mouth can barely suppress a giggle  henley begins   new pilot  prince of westerburg  henley   born              first  pet   rabbit  bombo   favorite flower      he clears his throat  very embarrassing   blue thinking whistles     match  replied the computer   fasten your seatbelts   rocktar pak ls is  made  while  in  motion   but  more  interesting  is  the  following   henley scratches  his  head   patchara  petch  asks  for a boon    bombo  hare  favorite flower blue remember  are you full of surprises  sweet prince    henley  is embarrassed   is not often enough    i  think  i was nine   i know that  to ask me that  do i need to change the same          no   patchara raises his  hand    leave  it   is  very  safe  do  you  know  that  you are  two days  younger  than me   i  was  born  in  xanqog                      nice  to    know now i  thinks henley always a little out of tune  but not two minutes later  it  is  already  forgotten   the  rocktar  has  reached  its  runway   the fireworks  in  the  background  is  heard   probably  the  highlight  of  the wild pakingerfete  not a single soul can be seen out here  almost silently you take off   tells you   henley begins  it is good that i missed my father      patchara  looks  at  him  incredulously   and  svinenysh   oh  who  sleeps behind  that is why it is so quiet  the young prince continues   just as i was slapped eivind  my father would have done the same  the treat me like a wailing baby  was i  too  such as ten years ago gerademal  lol  but today  the spin  i ll show where i am right     do you really have no fear  patchara  she looks back and forward   oh you know  we have already come so far     also with you my personal and special projects assistant svinenysh  back  there  what  could  possibly  go wrong     only  now  she realizes how tired she is  finally  a last look at the control monitor  then   looks  like he  is heading directly  to his turb  then up  to  the exo  your moon  who would  have  thought  a  few weeks  yawn  now  for  the  first time  a  nap   nighty  night      a  few  minutes  later   henley  is  already  on dreams   the  sleeper   however   is  heading  for  the  barren  steppe  exo moon  home world of birds and etto home  town a secret  factory of her majesty queen hypatia  i  personally  the prairie moon exo even  today  settled more than two hundred years after the start of the new era  barely  there  is  even  only  a  single  small  town  inhabited  permanently   this  is clearly  rooted  in  the  mentality  of  paking   historically   these  fur  seals  originally  therefore  you live by the sea  this easy to satellite barren and dry  while there are freshwater  some rivulets  streams and even one or two  shallow  water   but  apart  from  these  small  lakes  or  even  oceans  inland  waters  are  missing  completely   it  is  a  desert  world  in  the  most prominent  are  the  spring  beutler   it  is

analog species  where is the best place to start  when is the best time  almost every night on the satellites is clearly a star  so do these also  his star  who is prime pak but just risen in the green blue half moon   so  you  can  see  fairly  well   there  is  a  certain  brightness    available   if  he  were  fully  illuminated  one  would  even  can  distinguish colors   still   the  nano erase  board  exa  lighting  machine  city  ii  is  now very close  three wheelers in dangerous missions flit black at the lowest speed toward your goal  exa nano is on course  for the first time in the cold distant lights are visible  little machine city in mind  he is tilting  after a particularly dense accumulation of steppe shrubs  the children rush to him  all  three  jump from your machine  the bot has his  instructions  he takes  the  lead    exa nano  now  marching  into  the  target  area   please follow      the  strange  triumvirate  set  in  motion   goal   destruction  of  an institution s  strategic  imperative  of  her  majesty  queen  hypatia  i maximum self  machine city  is a purpose built  flat consisting of several buildings   warehouses   factories  and  training  camps   the  system  is backed up by a several meter high electric fence around it  every touch means certain death  three attackers approaching  the first signs of the skulls  they  have  already  happened   then met  a  buzz  the  air   it  is  the standing under high voltage fence  up to here everything went well  but now  for a fraction of a second henley thinks it back to sprint to take his wheeler and then a  jump button to overcome the obstacle  but his new ally   exa nano  calculated  already   he  rattles  off    trivy     g         pak prime   skeletal  parameters  humanoid  life  forms  is  sufficient   he  takes his aim  their sights    no sound now  henley  prince at westerburg   he grabs the twelve year old boy by the collar and puts him back on the belt  then he throws him without warning in a high arc over the deadly barrier  henley  remains off  the air but he  refrains summarizes every sound  he assumes the posture of a runner and obstacle course leads sent from the impact energy over his shoulder  not a second  later he  is already back upright  what is served for there  black cat in the night  no it is patchara petch a boon   this  also  comes  in  a  high  arc  sailing  along   it  is  no obstacle course racer  so the henley  is  in position and catches his best friend and courageous campaigner sent to in order to beat it with her  the young diplomat s daughter shakes  but is otherwise intact  she is looking exa nano   this  is  against  the  fence   just  bends  downwards   as  he stretches a spring  then he  jumps out of  the deadly stand elegantly on the fence  four meters are a breeze for exa mil  the children have now found shelter next to a tool shed  exa nano now comes to you also   find production network  signal strength       he croaks   start with the login procedure        the  password  has  been  changed   then  it  gets    complicated   no   this  time  you  hold  the  luck   in  fact  s  is  less  a  stupid accident   but  rather  the  quick  and  decisive  action  by  our  three  heroes  the  robot  will  rattle    entry  point  domain  mil exomc    registration successful    highly  strained  and  his  forehead  wrinkles  observed  in  the children  of  your  new  colleagues   this  continues  unmoved    starting upload  of  additional  individual exa subs  on  mil class  nano bots exomc   application of new mission parameters pacifist  runs  reaction norm  is  extended   the  result  is  unclear   object oriented  and  therefore could cause unforeseen evolutionary dynamic group phenotype  exa is to be expected by nano this scenario     no  no  it sounds in unison from patcharas henleys and mouth  autism  is a mathematical approach   the last  thing  they can use now    good work  exa nano  but now  it  says  to wait   challenge  yourself  on  one  unpredictable   events  similar  to  war   adds patchara  no emotion when spoken to  what will happen now  no one knows for sure  one thing is certain  the attack on machine city ii on the  steppes  of  the  pak moon  exo  prime  in  indi  system  has  begun  in exactly two minutes      xxxii   darkest  hour  another  three  uneventful  minutes  pass  like  hours   still  no  result   should  the  plan  fail   withdrawal  without  result  svin  s death in vain  it looks bad to you ordered  at least exa nano is still  online   it  even  has  the  impression  that  scurry  his  subs  in  a  secret language  then everything  goes  very  quickly  clink  shatters  a window somewhere   lights  go  on   sirens  start  to  howl   the  bot  pulls  his  head towards  the  noise  source   he  rattles  off    the  attack  begins  mil units must monitor  exa nano input needed for new allocated learning matrix    he  sprints  off  towards  noise   further  inside  the  complex    no   wait   walking  and  running  behind  henley  applied  immediately   but  he  turns around again and snorted   you stay here patchara  the fence  got it  i ll be  right  back      henley  comes  around  the  next  curve  and  the  image  which provides him here verschl gt the language  blinding light s is now everywhere   sparks  spraying  from  buildings   smoke  rises   the  alarm shrieks  your  nasty  sinus  tone   exa no  trace  of  nano   but  what  is  even worse   just  around  the  next  corner  a  whole  squadron  of  exa mils  is applied in a destructive mission  who knows why  you could do without it   it  is  unnecessary   however   they  probably  want  to  verbally communicate your new knowledge and the technology department  they    rattle  and  gurgle   it s  wrong   chases  you  out   exa million  in  a  new mission  in freedom  away with you     a truly cruel chorus  the pack is supplied directly shot at henley  this is right on the asphalt  defenseless on the front  line  what this brings his rapid fire weapon in single mode  zero   he  throws  down   you  stomp  him  flat   he  has  only  one  choice  henley remains just stand quietly and tells the moving companions thus easy to rush past him on the back to continue their destructive work  far from  it   a  deadly miscalculation   the  first  exa  it  has  already  achieved  the bot takes over the small henley only as a disturbing resistance was standing  in  his  way   like  a  piece  of  wood   he  drives  from  his  arm  clutching  the poor boy and  throws him  to  the  left of  the  full  force of  the cold   fresh looking  building  plastered  to  him   the  impact  is  brutal  seriously injured  bleeding  remains to prince henley westerburg at that fateful  wall  unconscious   the  herd  has  tramplende  simply  ignores  the event  meanwhile  she sets her new role  the destruction of city machine ii  continued  unmoved   and  patchara   what  happens  to  you   she crouches still on the outside edge of the campus  waiting for the return of your  friend   the  seconds  tick  like  days   the  noise  goes  away  steamroller equal work  the company struggle through the camp  chance of even human screams and shots are heard  probably a technician in a losing  battle   if  only  henley  came  back   then  everything  was  good   it would  fall  to  him  around  the  neck   a  nice  last  second   a  more  livable thoughts  about  the  young  diplomat s  daughter  patchara  petch a boon  but it is different  she feels a pain  on the ear she pulls up the unnamed guard  so  long until  it  stands upright    whom have we here   he grins   look  here   so  that s  that   cause  found      patchara  wildly  waving  his arms  she  lashes out kick out  and you succeed  in  the greatest effort  to solve his grip  her hand moves  to  your colt  a big mistake  the guard noticed  this and kick  the gun out of your hand   it  is applied as hell and hits  with the flat of your hand  he proposes in the face so hard that you crash   he  draws  his  gun    you  nasty  little  witch    he  snorts   patchara looks at him without moving a muscle  you know  one wrong move and he pulls  the trigger  he  is  jubilant    what a  triumph   i  like yuri petrovich said that these hosts are all the bottles from the war have no idea     an attack  as predicted by me  therefore  the wind blows  actually  i should deliver you alive with my superiors  i bet you can sing well    he thinks for a moment    but how can  i get you  to poison  fury out of here  lalala  is    hard  enough  for  me  alone       you  know  what   i ll  do  you  like  better platform   i  was  alone   no  less  than
